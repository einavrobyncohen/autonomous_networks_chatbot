All Rights Reserved. Page 7 of 8 1 AN Scenario Realizations 1. 1 Introduction Autonomous Network practices can improve both the operational efficiency and end-user experience of todays operator use case. This guide describes scenario realizations of operator use cases using an autonomy mindset and, in particular, the mechanisms described in the AN technical architecture (IG1230). Using closed control feedback and intent-driven interactions, we can deploy smart software to continuously monitor and optimize the networks. Autonomous Networks have become a prerequisite for many more advanced use-cases. For example, with 5G and Software-Defined Networks, often the topology of the network itself is dynamic: higher-level application services dynamically change their network requirements in the same way as cloud-computing applications elastically change their compute requirements. Autonomous Networks can enable concepts like Digital Twins that allow you to model and dynamically simulate changes to a Network to de-risk such changing requirements. Another example is for mission-critical services that require the network to be in the loop. An Autonomous Network can interact with the higher-level mission-critical service through APIs to warn of potential service interruptions. An autonomous vehicle could, for example, be warned about crossing an international/roaming boundary and the vehicle could adopt a limited-network mode where it drives more slowly. For industries like healthcare, aviation, and transport, Autonomous Networks must support the move from best-effort networks to ultra-reliable network-in-the-loop services. This section describes several real-world examples of where operator use cases and requirements were realized using the core concepts of the AN technical architecture.

The ecosystem is heavily reliant on connectivity services, and oftentimes communication issues (especially outages) wont go unnoticed by customers. This challenge presents a differentiation opportunity for those who have continuity plans for all scenarios. Connectivity and connectivity related services are needed to enable the EV charging customer journey in several ways: Finding nearby public charge points and checking their availability, connector compatibility, charge level, and in some cases: booking a charging time slot. In the event the driver is outside their local area navigating to the selected public charge point using one of the many mobile navigation apps (Google Maps, TomTom Go, HERE WeGo, Sygic, etc. )  Performing a payment pre-authorization to unlock the EV charging station equipment. This is a key difference with the gasoline-based car industry: network connectivity is not required to pump gas, it is for the electric car industry (the one exception being home charger). Autonomous Networks Scenario Realizations v1. 1  TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 12 of 13 Figure 3-1 EV Charging Ecosystem If any of the above have an issue they can debilitate the EV charging customer journey, and result in lost revenue for charge point station operators. This has consequences across the broader ecosystem. Thus, a differentiated business continuity solution offering from a CSP (or even a group of CSPs working together) can help better address these pain points and enable a smoother customer experience. The solution addresses two requirements addressed by different autonomous services, as outlined in Table 1. Note that the business capabilities are per reference guide IG1218, and the Self-X capability applies to all of them. 3. 2 AN Business Capabilities needed to support Services Table 1 EV Charging infrastructure requirements, metrics, and business capabilities Service Autonomous Network Requirements, Metrics, Business Capabilities

All Rights Reserved. Page 15 of 16 - Online service selection and information: EV drivers can use a mobile or in-car dashboard application to locate the nearest charging stations providing charging services. Drivers can also see all details and status of the chargepoint infrastructure (e. g. , what type of connectors are supported, how much power is available to discharge, usage state) - Online service ordering: EV drivers can use a mobile or in-car dashboard application to book a timeslot at a specific chargepoint. - Zero-touch payment: EV drivers can swipe a fob or card to authenticate for payment. The chargepoint then communicates over the network to the chargepoint management system which authenticates the account and subsequently unlocks the chargepoint. The charge to the customer account is applied after the vehicle has been charged. - After the charge is completed the customer can opt to receive an email with a sales receipt. - Agile deployment The AN stack uses all-scenario automation capabilities to implement intelligent service orchestration, resource orchestration, and process orchestration, improving network deployment agility and implementing process scheduling and orchestration of atomic capabilities. Automated modeling from service requirements to slice and MEC resources, automatic online network resource evaluation, one-click slice deployment, and automatic slice configuration, automated service testing quickly implements automatic closed loop in all scenarios during network OM and meets the requirements of agile provisioning of electric power services in the industry market. - Intelligent OM The AN stack uses technologies such as neural networks and knowledge graphs to automatically provide optimal intelligent OM policies. It uses ML-derived dynamic thresholds, KPI association analysis, and automatic sub-health detection to detect and provide notification of faults in advance, and AI-based fast fault locating and slice self-healing. - Intelligent failover: The AN stack performs self-monitoring of both fixed and wireless networks involved in the business continuity solution. In the event of a fixed network outage, a wireless network slice is available and self-scaling is used to grow the size of the slice as needed, maximizing resource efficiency. If the geographical area of the fixed network outage grows the AN will perform automatic resource matching with the wireless network and automatically adds the relevant wireless to the scope of the network slice. - Network outage prediction: AI-based network performance functions within the AN use weather and other IoT sensor data to make predictions on future weather conditions on how it will impact the network and network services. Autonomous Networks Scenario Realizations v1. 1  TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 16 of 17 - Auto application onboarding: At service order time the AN keeps a record of the mobile application used to serve consumers charging point information. This application would normally run in a centralized public cloud. If a network outage prediction is made that is deemed to impact the EV charging infrastructure the application is onboarded into the appropriate MEC data centers. - Zero-trust DDoS in MEC: Within wireless and core networks there are backoff and access barring mechanisms that detect and prevent denial of service attacks. These mechanisms are governed by configuration. AI algorithms can be used to further optimize these parameters in the event of ever more sophisticated attacks. 3. 4 Business Capabilities To address the pain points and challenges mentioned, the following business capabilities are provided. While the term not mentioned explicitly below these are fortified with Zero X capabilities in the context of AN. Customer management: This capability provides the ability to control, predict, process, organize, present, and analyze all information, documents, preferences, experiences, and history related to an individual or organization that has, plans to have, or has had an account with the business. It encompasses several other detailed capabilities such as definition, authentication and authorization, preference management, portfolio management, customer matching, and customer information management. A few (not all) are mentioned below. Customer authentication and authorization: This capability provides the ability to verify customer identity and access rights in the context of a given business scenario and allow a customer to proceed based on those rights or otherwise prevent the customer from proceeding. Customer information management: This capability provides the ability to organize, track, report on or otherwise disseminate attributes, data, and other perspectives about a customer. Order management: This capability provides the ability to place, validate, cancel, change, track, fulfill, and otherwise manage a request by one party to another to buy, sell, or exchange goods or services. Incident management: The capability provides the ability to detect, collect data on, organize, respond and remediate reported troubles/incidents. Product management: The capability provides the ability to conceptualize, design, develop, bundle, price, launch, maintain and retire goods and services offered by the business. Network management: The capability provides the ability to design the architecture and plan, develop, deploy, monitor, and report on the network infrastructure. It encompasses several other detailed capabilities such as design, lifecycle management, performance management, compliance management, access management, A few (not all) are mentioned below. Autonomous Networks Scenario Realizations v1. 1  TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 17 of 18 Network design: This capability provides the ability to conceptualize, specify, and model features that a network should have. From an AN perspective, the designs would be automatically generated based on network intent and verified. Network compliance management: in addition to customer and service intent there are also other business requirements to comply with local rules, e. g. , EMF emissions in wireless networks. These would be fed into the business layer and implemented within the wireless autonomous domain. Network matching: This provides the capability of locating the appropriate resource instances with which to deliver the network intent. 3. 5 Using the AN Framework Figure 3-2 5G Ride On 2020 Catalyst using AN Framework Figure 3-2 shows how the AN framework can be applied to a specific business objective, namely business continuity. The need for resilience connectivity to provide reliable services was the key focus. The Charge Point Operators as CSP customer is connected to the network using cross-layer customer loop. The vendors provided the system platforms that realized Self- X capabilities and closed loops required. The network is organized into three separate autonomous domains, namely Access, Transport, and Edge-Core. Self-healing and Self- protection within Fixed and Wireless access using 5G, with MEC orchestration and MEC offloading for self-optimization in the Edge Domain.

# Methodology

This section now describes two use case examples that apply the AN Level evaluation methodology described in IG1230. 4. 1 Level Evaluation for IPRAN Assurance This section selects the monitoring and troubleshooting of the IPRAN network of mobile 2C service as an example to describe the Autonomous Network Level. The monitoring and troubleshooting process is one of the most important processes in CSP network OM. The full autonomy of the monitoring and troubleshooting process can reduce the workload of personnel and lower the skill requirements for OM personnel, the troubleshooting duration can be shortened to improve end-user experience. Operation process and operation tasks for the IPRAN network of mobile 2C service are divided into the monitoring and troubleshooting operation process into nine operation tasks. Task A: Intent Translation. Based on the monitoring and assurance requirements and SLA assurance policies, determine network monitoring rules, such as the monitored area, monitored object (such as NEs or services), alarm type, alarm severity, KPI type, and alarm reporting policy for KPI exceptions. The system monitors the network based on the network monitoring rules. Task B: Fault identification. Monitors and analyzes network operation data and external data to detect unexpected service interruptions or service quality deterioration promptly. Task C: Potential Risk Prediction. Monitors and analyzes network operation data and external data, predicts the trend of network software and hardware status, and detects potential exceptions in advance. Task D: Problem Demarcation. Demarcate faults based on the identified faults and potential risks. In the cross-domain scenario, demarcate the fault to a specific technical domain. In the single-domain scenario, demarcate the fault to a specific NE. Task E: Root cause location. Based on the problem demarcation result, further locate the specific software and hardware causes (such as configurations, boards, and optical modules) of the problem to support the generation of rectification solutions and rectify services as soon as possible. Task F: Recovery solution generation. Based on the fault demarcation and locating results, generate several alternative recovery solutions, such as modifying configurations, restarting NEs, replacing boards, and isolating NEs. Task G: Solution evaluation and decision-making. Evaluate the repair solution (such as whether the solution can solve the problem, whether the repair cost is acceptable, and the extra impact on the network), and provide the optimal solution. Autonomous Networks Scenario Realizations v1. 1  TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 19 of 20 Task H: Recovery solution implementation. Recovery faults and eliminate potential risks based on the optimal solution. For example, deliver configurations to the network for software faults, isolate NEs or links for hardware faults, or replace or remove boards or optical modules onsite. Task I: Service verification. After fault recovery and risk elimination are performed, verify and confirm the execution results, such as whether service interruption, quality deterioration, and alarms and KPI exceptions are cleared. 6. 1. 1 Task Criteria for monitoring and troubleshooting of IPRAN network of mobile 2C services Each task can be completed manually by a human operator, or jointly by the operator and the system, or fully automatically by the system. The following table lists the monitoring and troubleshooting autonomous level standards based on the division of Manual and system Table 2 Level Evaluation for monitoring and troubleshooting of IPRAN Level0 All monitoring and troubleshooting tasks are manually completed. Level1 Problem identification (Task B), Problem Demarcation ( Task D), Root cause analysis( Task E), recovery solution implementation (Task H), and Services verification( Task I) are completed by manual and systems (for example, automatic data collection and manual fault identification). Level2 Based on level 1, Recovery solution implementation (Task H) can be completed automatically by the system. Level3 Problem identification (Task B), Problem Demarcation (Task D), recovery solution implementation (Task H), and service verification (Task I) can be automatically completed by the system. Level4 All other tasks except Intent Translation (Task A) are automated. Level5 All tasks are automatically completed by the system. Autonomous Networks Scenario Realizations v1. 1  TM Forum 2021.

The Problem identification task and Problem Demarcation task are highly automated. The system collects network alarm, performance, and topology data and automatically aggregates and analyzes the data to accurately identify and demarcate problems. 4. 2 Level Evaluation for HBB Intelligent OM This section selects Monitoring and troubleshooting of the Home  Access  Metro network for home broadband service (HBB OM) as an example to describe the Autonomous Network Level. The HBB OM analysis, task description, task capability criteria, etc. are for reference, and some need to be further researched. Home broadband (HBB) maintenance is to ensure the voice, Internet, video services, etc. , which are carried by the HBB network, it involves fault reporting, network monitoring, network fault handling, network risk check, and potential risk elimination, etc. The following shows the requirement architecture of home broadband OM. Network-based complaints rising generally go through three phases: Network Risk/Degradation, Network fault, and User complaint. Customers requirements and network maintenance focus vary across those phases. Autonomous Networks Scenario Realizations v1. 1  TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 22 of 23 Figure 4-1 Home broadband OM requirements architecture 4. 2. 1 Operation process and operation tasks Base on the 3 phases and service layer described above, there are 3 user cases: Proactive Faults Prediction and Prevention, Massive fault interception, and Network fault intelligent diagnosis. Figure 4-2 Operational processes home broadband OM use cases We take UC1 to describe the evaluation method in detail. Note: UC1 focuses on phase 1 based on Figure - Home broadband OM requirements architecture, so there is no task - Fault identification in Awareness. Autonomous Networks Scenario Realizations v1. 1  TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 23 of 24 Figure 4-3 Fault Prediction and Prevention workflow The workflow of proactive faults prediction and prevention use case begins with operation intent. The system receives operation intent from the human operator and translates it into operational rules. These rules specify how the system runs to achieve the goal of operation intent. And the system organizes serial tasks to implement the operation rules. Typically, the tasks can be classified into 4 types: Awareness, Analysis, Decision, and Execution as shown in Figure 4-3. The tasks form a closed control loop with network devices to continuously ensure the achievement of operation intent. The tasks of this use case are listed as follows: Table 5 Task of UC1-HBB Fault Prediction and Prevention Task Name Function description for UC1

It is not only related to technical KPI but also related to the customers organization, manpower, and network resource performance, etc. Technical KPI: To support service KPI, some technical indicators reflect the system capability, we named them Technical KPI. It is the system specifications that dictate the maximum capability of the system under certain conditions. For example, Scenario coverage rate, Identification granularity (like network/port level, service level, application-level), Automation rate, etc. It needs to be further researched. Capabilities criteria based on task for AN level of HBB Proactive Faults Prediction and Prevention is as below in Table 6 Task level evaluation reference criteria for AN level of HBB Proactive Faults Prediction and Prevention.
