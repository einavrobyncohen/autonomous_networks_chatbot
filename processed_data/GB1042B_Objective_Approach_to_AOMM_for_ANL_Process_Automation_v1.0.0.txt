All Rights Reserved Page 5 of 61 Executive Summary Digital transformation has been in the heart of most organizations as they reinvent their operating model to win in the digital world. To ensure that their digital operating model is effective, organizations are integrating customer experience management as part of the core elements across their organization. To enhance on developing an effective customer centricity capability, customer experience focus has been added to the AOMM operation flow as we assess and grow the maturity level of the service capabilities. The intent of this guidebook is to provide organizations with an objective approach in assessing their autonomous operation maturity level. With a clear understanding of the current maturity level, organizations will be able to set their next level target along their digital transformation journey towards operational excellence in aligning to their business strategy. The objective approach will include  Process mining technique in providing a process transparency to identify areas of optimization.  An AOMM model to provide a methodical step in classifying the autonomous operation capabilities and designing a service capability roadmap.  A value operation framework in quantifying and assessing the values through a list of operation metrics. To guide organizations in effectively measuring and managing their autonomous operations, a step by step best practice to a catalyst contributed scenario has been included as an illustration to pursue the ZTO journey. GB1042B Objective Approach to AOMM for ANL Process Automation v1.0.0  TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved Page 6 of 61 Introduction Digital transformation journey is in acceleration mode across all industries. Organizations are rapidly transforming and building business capabilities across functions to realize their corporate strategic framework. The intent of this guidebook is to make use of the assets generated from the Catalyst contribution which includes the Autonomous Operation Maturity Model AOMM tool and an objective approach to the AOMM assessment for the Autonomous Network Level ANL process automation. The use of ANL to formulate an impact on autonomous operations by way of improving process automation helped the CSP to establish a baseline and target state for its process automation. This helped to identify process automation capability gaps. The impact analysis can support prioritization and reprioritization based on business motivation that is linked to the Value Operations Framework VOF. The champions challenge statement of the Catalyst defined the requirement of having a more objective approach to assess the current service capability maturity level, and transparently identify areas of optimization driving towards ZTO. To realize the capability development and value assessment of the digital transformation initiative, a minimum viable product MVP on VoLTE service quality monitoring to problem resolution was introduced and served as an illustration to guide the understanding of the objective AOMM approach and value assessment. To execute the digital transformation strategy, many organizations have adopted customer experience management or customer centricity as a core element to their operating model. In shaping the operation model to align with the strategic framework, maturity assessment of the service capabilities related to customer experience management are considered in the operation flow. The innovative asset generated from the Catalyst is the data and value driven operations that adopts the process mining technique which replays a process map that mapped against the ANL model to provide an objective assessment approach and enables identification of areas for process optimization. The above provides concise text to help introduce the catalysts focus. This document is targeted at business decision makers and operations owners in the Communication Service Provider industry and Enterprise undergoing digital operation transformations, as well as being of particular relevance to CTO, CIO, CMO, Head of Customer Experience Management, Head of Digital Transformation, Head of Networks Operation, Head of Network Operations Center, Head of Service Operations Center together with their architects, network planning, designers, customer care, customer experience management, OSS and DevOps team from both IT and CT backgrounds. This document will also position the TM Forums work on Autonomous Networks Concept  Framework, and Autonomous Network Realization Approach Framework in relation to the Autonomous Operations project implementation and service capability roadmap planning in the solutions development moving forward.

The Catalyst Challenge This TM Forum catalyst 22.0.387 focused on a challenge of service providers tackling increasing OPEX and customer experience management shortfalls as network expansion and sophistication brought scale and multiclass of service delivery to operations. Typically, CSPs need clear understanding of existing business capabilities in order to set milestone targets given knowledge of the gaps between ASIS and TO BE maturity levels. These gaps can then be analyzed from viewport of their operations pain points, as well as the underpinning capabilities required in order to realize their ambition. The challenges identified for the catalyst to address are covered in the following section. 1.1. Infrastructure Complexity CSPs are going through major infrastructure transitions to deal with increasing bandwidth demands from customers. While 5G networks are increasingly coming online and expanding, CSPs still have to manage their 2G, 3G, and 4G networks too. In addition, CSPs are also transforming their hardwarebased network to virtualized, and software architecture to bring agility and improve service delivery. Besides, the transition also includes integrating cloud model into a backhaul of telecom network, as central or edge cloud to raise scalability. With the coexistence of 4 network generations, virtualization and cloudification, the infrastructure is not only becoming more complex, but also costlier to manage as it requires higher caliber talents who are kept updated with operation competence and knowledge. With the network grows in complexity, the operating cost can be contained by keeping the network reliable. This can be made possible through service capability development in accelerating the maturity level for autonomous operation. 1.2. Increased Operational Expenditure In a competitive telecommunications market, the telecommunications sector was firmly focused on revenue growth rather than operational efficiency. However, the revenue is not growing at a faster rate than the growing cost, forcing communications service providers CSPs to focus increasingly on cost management and, more recently, cost cutting. GB1042B Objective Approach to AOMM for ANL Process Automation v1.0.0  TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved Page 8 of 61 Figure 11 Increased OPEX at the Peak of 2345G Coexistence The operating expenses OPEX are going to rise sharply during the 5G migration as the legacy networks 2G3G4G will continue to function in parallel with 5G for years to come. Although 5G services could generate new revenue, the prevalence of legacy systems and operational processes that arent equipped to handle the increasing complexities of service and network operations would result in high consumption of budgetary resources and process inefficiencies, which would eventually affect long term profitability and Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization EBITDA. CSPs will continue to struggle to provide highquality services and maintain their competitive advantage if they rely on increasing headcount and skills to manage future networks, which is not sustainable in the long run. A new digital operating model is needed to deliver service agility, significantly reduce OPEX and tackle the complexities of new foundational technologies. 1.3. Necessity for new class of services Service evolution has given a new dimension to end users expectation where end users may be nonhuman and that need communication loop to complete just in time and in rare situations just on time. Such a critical form of service delivery cannot be achieved if there is no end to end full automation with a high degree of accuracy. Hence, automation becomes a basic foundational need for certain evolving services. It is not a desire but a necessity. GB1042B Objective Approach to AOMM for ANL Process Automation v1.0.0  TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved Page 9 of 61 Delivering Digital Services Profitably with Excellent Customer Experience Besides focusing on OPEX reduction with network automation assisted with Artificial IntelligenceMachine Learning to gradually reduce costly and timeconsuming legacy practices regarding service and network operations, it is also imperative for CSPs to shift their operational focus from the network toward customers and services to deliver superior customer experience. An excellent customer experience can help CSPs differentiate themselves from the rest of the competition, enabling them to realize business value by delivering digital services profitably. A Temkin Group Study measured customer experience across 61 large tech companies using the Net Promoter Score NPS metric. It was found that even a moderate increase in NPS for a company with a 1B revenue resulted in an 823M increase in revenue over three years Theht. Customers who are satisfied with the service will spend more than compared to the ones who have had an unpleasant experience. The research report, Global Insights on Succeeding in the Customer Experience Era, reveals that for telecommunication industry, 49 of customers are willing to pay more for great customer experiences OKeeffe  Company, 2013. This shows that by improving your customer experience offering, the company can increase the Customer Lifetime Value CLV. A high CLV means each customer will bring in more revenue for the company, maximizing the marketing Return on Investment ROI and reducing the cost on customer acquisition to drive sales. Thus, it is important to develop capabilities in the customer experience management to provide enhanced and personalized digital services to develop a sustainable operating model in delivering digital services to their customers. GB1042B Objective Approach to AOMM for ANL Process Automation v1.0.0  TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved Page 10 of 61 2. Reinvent Operating Model 2.1. Winning Formula for Autonomous Operations There is a need to have a digital operating model in approaching digitalization of their operations  meaning the use of technology to improve performance. The need to put in place a digital operating model that is sustainable for new levels of speed, agility, efficiency, and effectiveness. However, implementing new technologies should not be seen as a tickbox activity of isolated performance improvements, but rather as a vital next step in the continuous quest to better address customers needs throughout the customer journey to ensure sustainable competitiveness. The question is what would be the capabilities an organization would need to build in order to support the digital operating model. The capabilities that are required to align operation to business in executing the digital transformation strategy effectively. 2.2. Customer Experience Management To enable the offer of a profitable and personalized digital service, it is imperative to build capabilities in the customer experience management that effectively integrate to the organization and digital operation model. A customer experience is a journey or amalgamation of interactions a customer or potential customer has with a business. It is how customers perceive the services offered by a service provider which results in how they think of the service provider as a brand and ultimately creates brand loyalty. Measuring this process with customer experience metrics is important if the service provider wants to boost customer retention. Quality of Experience QoE is a measure of the overall level of customer satisfaction with a service provider. It is a subjective measure from the users perspective of the overall quality of the service provided. QoE has historically emerged from Quality of Service QoS, which attempts to objectively measure service parameters such as packet loss rates or average throughput. Therefore, operations should be equipped with the ability to be aware of how the customers perceive the services through transaction net promoter score survey and automatically detect service anomaly. The failure to be aware, analyze, decide and execute service recovery on time before customer experiences the service disruption is subject to impact on customer lifetime value or even churn. As a result, the revenue, profitability and even brand name are affected. In order to build capabilities that are related to customer experience, we need the ability to assess the maturity level and build the capability within the digital operation model in aligning to the strategic framework. GB1042B Objective Approach to AOMM for ANL Process Automation v1.0.0  TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved Page 11 of 61 3. New approaches and capabilities to drive the digital operation model There is an increasing interest across the ICT industry to further develop the digital operation model and drive implementations aimed to provide verticals, enterprise and consumers with autonomous operations and more innovative services featuring zero wait, zerocontact, zerofault and full autonomy capabilities. At the same time, many challenges need to be solved in terms of how to objectively approach the AOMM for ANL process automation, build, operate and run those networks that are characterized as selfserved, selfhealing and above all, selfoptimized deployments 1. The simple answer is to follow its target architecture and satisfy the industry accepted implementation path for full digitalization and intelligentization of network operation and maintenance. In reality, more constructive and concrete help is needed from many aspects in practice. Here, we are trying to provide some clear steps and more constructive directions that would be of use and instrumental in Autonomous Operations practices, when deploying and operating the 3 Layers and 4Closed Loops TM Forum AN Framework 2. The AN Level Framework illustrates the combination of both human operators P and autonomous systems S involved in achieving certain level of autonomy and proposes the following Lifecycle Management categories of capabilities shown below  Execution  the execution of a decided solution which could be adjusting and configuring the network parameters.  Awareness  the tasks of collecting data from external environment which include network performance data, network configuration data, quality or status of the service, and customer related information such as SLA.  Analysis  the group of tasks that analyze data generated in the awareness stage and use available technology to predict a change or future status or make an applicable recommendation for decision.  Decision  the tasks of evaluating the recommended network adjustment solutions, operation scope or customer experience related solution options for required management and operation decision to be executed.  IntentExperience  the tasks of generating and determining network optimization related, service operation related, or customer experience related control information. 3.1. Service Capability Maturity Assessment through AOMM Operation Flows The AOMM provides organization with a best practice methodology and tool to assess asis business capability and set target across the business operation, service and resource operations flow that includes Planning, Deployment, Maintenance, Optimization and Operations. For each of the operation flow, it is decomposed into subflow with service capabilities that can be referenced to the eTOM business process. For ease of reference to the eTOM business process, each of the operation subflows is mapped with the eTOM process. In order to build service capability in the areas of customer experience management, a few customer experiences related sub flows are added to the Planning and Operations AOMM operation flow introduced in IG1269. GB1042A Objective Approach to AOMM for ANL Process Automation v1.0.0 TM Forum 2022. All Rights Reserved. Page 12 of 61 Figure 31 The 5 AOMM Operation Flows GB1042A Objective Approach to AOMM for ANL Process Automation v1.0.0 TM Forum 2022. All Rights Reserved. Page 13 of 61 The Autonomous Operations AO capabilities for any relevant scope of activities and tasks needed to be defined within the operation flow context are realized by designing service intents and associated control loops to describe necessary steps needed to fulfill defined business goals and certain management purposes. This intentdriven approach starts from describing what are desired outcomes from an Autonomous Domain, rather than exposing details of how to configure resources within any Autonomous Domain and presents essential prerequisites for enabling Self X capabilities. Closedloops are on the other side an essential part of an Autonomous Domain optimization of relevant services and their operational behaviors, like resource usage optimization, costeffectiveness goals and perfecting tradeoffs between tenant service types and resource instances required to be involved. Autonomous Domains may be composed of one more closedloop and if required those closed control loops could be bound together to realize the intentdriven services for supporting resources according to the defined supervision and control objectives. Also, one control loop can be used across multiple Autonomous Domains, so a bigger Autonomous Domain can be constructed by its design to serve necessary business goals. The key focus of building Autonomous Operations deployments is on developing stronger and more effective Customer Experience Management and Customer Support capabilities, based on agility through specific intents and the consistency imposed by relevant closedloop control mechanisms. 3.2. Capability Buildup Domains 3.2.1. Customer Experience Management As part of the Planning stage, the first proposed Capacity Management capability is aimed, through its intent at proactively strengthening Customer Experience Management CEM where possible and delivered through carefully defined tasks within each closedloop. Proactive User Experience Management is designed through a Machine learning model for eliciting customer insights and predictive user experience planning based on measuring service usage characteristics service uptake, app trend, service KQIs and customer behavior patterns HVC trends, customer complaints, FCR to improve customer satisfaction. The five Lifecycle Management categories of tasks for the Proactive User Experience Planning capability are shown in the following figure. 3.2.2. Predictive User Experience Planning Catalyst Scenario for Predictive User Experience Planning GB1042B Objective Approach to AOMM for ANL Process Automation v1.0.0  TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved Page 14 of 61 Figure 32 Capacity Planning  Predictive User Experience Planning Closed Loop The Aware dimension of the predictive user experience planning operation flow covers the group of tasks aimed at being continuously aware about service usage characteristics, service update and usage trends through Key Performance Indicators and Key Quality Indicators of the particular service. At the same time, the system is aware of the resource inventory management status to achieve a balance between QoE and resource dynamically reallocation. Then, Analysis category is about the group of tasks with a goal to analyze individual service consumption and resource demand through metrics like ARPU, Data of Usage DoU, type of package, KPIs, as well as internal service demands measured via Key Quality Indicators, service update, number of device replacements and supply factors metrics like network capacity utilization rate, traffic congestion rate, and the geographical coverage. Following the Analysis stage and based on all results generated, a Decision group of tasks makes relevant decisions about the analyzed service uptake, user migration or other type of user acquisitions and customer segment growth and in general performs decisionmaking how to achieve the Customer Satisfaction goals and at the same time balance the network supply. Based on all decisions made, the Execution group of tasks actually deliver this predictive user experience planning operation flow as part of Capacity Management. The execution also includes the activation of the policy, control function and service provisioning, proposed user migration and device replacement activities, proactive problemsolving, as well as delivering marketing campaigns and relevant offers and promotions, all with an ultimate goal of proactively and continuously improving customer experience and Net Promoter Score NPS. 3.2.3. Customer Support Catalyst Scenario for Customer Support Interface Management Within the Operation stage, Customer Support capabilities defined here with an intent to be able to interact with customer more effectively. Therefore, they are aimed at fully automating customer profile and interface management where feasible to implement those operation flows and needed to explore, record and manage customer profile and contact details, customer inventory and service requirements within its given closed loop, to achieve a more effective customer relationship during the whole Customer Lifecycle Management CLM. The Customer Support Interface Management closedloop with its Lifecycle Management categories of tasks are depicted in the figure below. GB1042B Objective Approach to AOMM for ANL Process Automation v1.0.0  TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved Page 15 of 61 Figure 33 Customer Support  Customer Support Interface Management closedloop The Aware dimension of the customer support interface management capability covers the group of tasks for monitoring a fully available set of customer profile and service requirements that are stored and regularly maintained in the user inventory. In the next closed loop stage, the Analysis dimension of tasks performs all necessary analysis of key customer details for effective support and specific tasks aimed at improving customer support interface functionality and customer experience management. Following the Analysis stage and based on all results generated, a Decision group of tasks decide on customer channel and right enduser interactions, and where feasible, appropriately selecting right user segments to deliver certain actions or tailored marketing campaigns. Based on all decisions made, the Execution group of tasks actually execute defined Customer Support activities across selected channels and perform selected tasks by using uptodate customer details during the customer interaction and service complaint resolution support. Catalyst Scenario to SLA Delivery using QoS Configuration The next operation flow is defined around Customer Support capability for Improving Quality of Service QoS in line with contractually binding Service Level Agreements SLA. The closedloop defined here has a goal of defining QoS metrics for analyzing key customer facing indicators and then, determining capability gaps. This autonomous capability, through its Lifecycle Management categories of tasks should be continuously adapting the E2E Operation maturity evaluation. Figure 34 Customer Support  Improve QoS in Meeting SLAs closedloop GB1042B Objective Approach to AOMM for ANL Process Automation v1.0.0  TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved Page 16 of 61 The Aware category of this customer support operation flow for improving Customer Experience is about selfaware performing tasks for all customer experience metrics and service KPIsKQIs, as well as contractual SLAs and service level targets defined for all service offerings. Then, the Analysis category of tasks analyzes all service indicators and metrics to identify potential gaps and service degradation for all commercially available services and their associated customer complaints and registered incidents. Based on all analysis outputs and results generated, a Decision group of tasks decide on actions and remedy activities needed to resolve identified service degradation and selected complaints. The decisionmaking should be driven with an ultimate goal of improving customer experience and meeting all defined Service Level Agreement targets and contractual commitments. Based on the decisions from the previous stage, the Execution group of tasks for this operation flow delivers actions and improvement tasks from the list of available activities in line with the criteria and targets setup in the contract or redefined in line with the business goals. Catalyst Scenario of Customer Retention and Loyalty The Customer Support capability for improving Customer Retention and Loyalty defines an intent of improving customer experience based on AIML support for managing customer Interaction and deriving realtime customer insights for automating Customer Lifetime Value CLV calculation. As such, it should include a selflearning model built with efficient customer behavior and pattern recognition and selflearning capability for identifying customer service usage trends, high value customer usage identification, registering events, campaigns and promotions taken, and where possible, optionally tracking typical and peculiar service preferences with perceived experience levels. The closedloop for improving Customer Retention and Loyalty with its Lifecycle Management task categories is shown in the figure below. Figure 35 Customer Operation  Customer Retention and Loyalty closedloop The Aware category of this operation flow for improving Customer Retention and Loyalty in line with Omnichannel strategy looks at all customer touchpoints available and monitors all user interactions, like customerhighvalue customer usage events, customer complaints, service and promotion uptakes and marketing conversion success rate, renewals, in order to get a full picture of all customers. GB1042B Objective Approach to AOMM for ANL Process Automation v1.0.0  TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved Page 17 of 61 Then, the Analysis category within this capability should define tasks to analyze all collected events and customer details, sorted out per each touchpoint and prioritized in line with evaluation metrics and relevant criteria to better understand the context and right purpose analysis results can fulfil. Based on all analysis outputs and the results generated, a Decision group of tasks decide upon identified actions and rules for service improvement activities that would boost customer satisfaction and brand loyalty. All decisions should have a direct correlation with Customer Satisfaction CSAT and Customer Lifetime Value CLV indicators to prove their validity in strengthening customer retention and loyalty. Based on all decisions made available, the Execution group of tasks should, in line with the priority list, execute proposed actions and service improvement activities, that would ultimately boost customer retention and customer loyalty with actual monetization and potential revenue improvement metrics. 3.3. Capability Assessment for Service The maturity level assessment of AOMM is carried out based on three steps 1. Defining the autonomous operation behavior of a specific network operations closed loop automation lifecycle that is made up of intent, awareness, analysis, decision, and execution stages of a control loop.mechanism. 2. Assessing degree of Autonomy for each of the stages of a control loop using coverage of the operation flow and the corresponding subflows. 3. Scoring the service capability of each operation subflow by weighting the results of the Step 2 assessment to create and overall Autonomous Level value. The assessment of each subflow will be on the capability of each closed loop stage intent, awareness, analysis, decision, and execution to complete its operation process.

However, the question is that does each of the 5 stages carry the same weightage. Prior to the framework maturing with a dimension weightage distribution methodology, the AOMM tool takes the assumption of an equal weighting distribution as shown in table 2. The list of questionnaire samples is constructed in a way to assist quick assessment of CSPs maturity in the ANL. The sequence of each response is mapped to the corresponding ANL. For example, the selection 1 of a question is mapped to Level 1 of the ANL. The selection 2 of a question is mapped to Level 2 of the ANL and so forth. After which, each subflow will be scored based on the merit of each of autonomous networks closed loop stage.

All Rights Reserved. . Page 45 of 61 4. Leveraging AOMM to align operations to business strategy The success of executing an organization strategy is dependent on how well the organization executes its operating model to achieve its business strategy. The operating model defines the model which includes the required business capabilities underpinning the people, process, resources and information necessary to implement the strategy. For instance, if an organization seeks the digital operating model to execute its digital transformation strategy, the question is whether there is a strong alignment between the organization capabilities, operating model and the business strategy. The AOMM will serve the purpose in the capability gaps identification and the capability blueprint formulation to prepare the operation in executing the strategy. 4.1. Objective AOMM Assessment The AOMM is introduced to provide an assessment of the organization asis capability maturity level, set the next level target, and identify the business capability gaps. The maturity assessment is scored from both the insideout and the outsidein view which could be from various functional teams and external consulting company. The objective for engaging multiple parties in the assessment is to assist in eliminating biasness or any possible hidden agenda. Maturity models are a common part of the transformation toolkit and are heavily used in project  process management, however research shows that they rarely result in performance improvements Jugdev, 2002. Maturity models are characterized by check lists against paper process which probably has undergone several rounds of changes in the field without diligently updated or process models that oversimplify reality and lack quantifiable evidence McCormack, 2009. This lack of empirical foundation results in recommendations and priorities that lack the economical foundation and the level of business justification required in telecom operators and enterprises who are looking for return of investment in months and not years. The company has agreed that they need to transform a part of the business and a transformation lead and team is established. This team will usually start by carrying out facetoface interviews with top managers and operational managers to get some guidance. Then key individuals in the organization will be identified for data gathering through workshops, questionnaires, calls etc. In parallel with this activity the key performance indicators KPIs of the programme will be identified and systems teams will be engaged to start producing glide paths and other relevant information. Data driven operations with process transparency will provide obvious and clear areas of enhancement and process optimization opportunity. Furthermore, consultants may be brought into benchmark, assess and advise on the current way of working and opportunities for change which typically introduces an industry maturity model. But all too often the consultant is applying lessons learned from a commercial environment geography, regulatory, contractual etc. that is often far different from the current operator. GB1042A Objective Approach to AOMM for ANL Process Automation v1.0.0  TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved Page 46 of 61 Therefore, when it comes to the AOMM assessment, it is imperative to have a transparent data driven process mining model in providing guidance to an objective and consistent approach in determining the AO maturity level and identifying areas of capability requirement to drive operation efficiency towards autonomy. 4.2. Process Mining Model There are four key stages behind the process mining model which will enable companies to use the model efficiently and technology providers to develop it further for specific industries. At the same time, the industry standard will provide the basis for further innovations, such as for expanding the scope of the system to include artificial intelligence, machine learning and then industrializing it. The process mining model when established as an industry standard will be instrumental in companies successful digital transformation. Figure 41 Process Mining Model The process mining model defines the 4stage process mining methodology, tools and process governance for standardized best practices, and rules and policy for closed loop automation enablement. The 4stage process mining are as follows 4.2.1. Process Discovery This technology extracts data from event logs in transactional systems that support key processes and makes it possible to understand and measure actual process flows and variations. In other words, it allows for process analysis without much human intervention. GB1042A Objective Approach to AOMM for ANL Process Automation v1.0.0  TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved Page 47 of 61 Figure 42 Event Log Sample Input for process mining is an event log. A traditional event log views a process from a particular angle provided by the case notion that is used to correlate events. Each event in such an event log refers to 1 a particular process instance called a case, 2 an activity, and 3 a timestamp. There may be additional event attributes referring to resources, people, costs, etc., but these are optional. With some effort, such data can be extracted from any information system supporting operational processes. processmining.org, n.d. 4.2.2. Process Analysis Process mining methodically discover event data and process models from the event logs, covert the CSV file to XES format where the process map is replayed and revealed the actual operation process flow. eXtensible Event Stream XES is the standard format for process mining adopted by the IEEE Task Force for logging events. During the process analysis stage, the application highlights the process non conformance from the target operating model, areas of process friction, identify improvement opportunities and recommends process enhancement. An understanding and measuring a process and the resources it consumes is important and valuable because it provides insights on the endtoend process with the alarm size and transit duration from one state to another. 4.2.3. Process Enhancement After much analysis is done on the event data behavior and process model, areas of optimization or improvement on the existing process model using information about the actual process recorded in the event log. One type of enhancement is service quality recovery, modifying the model to better reflect reality. For example, if two activities are modeled sequentially but in reality, can happen in any order, then the model may be corrected to reflect this. Extension could be another perspective of the process enhancement, for example, by using timestamps in the event log of the customer complaint handling process, the existing process model could be extended to show bottlenecks, service levels, and frequencies. To drive process automation, process models that involved long and much manual effort could be identified for process optimization, for example, introducing rules, policy and API for a closed loop automation. GB1042A Objective Approach to AOMM for ANL Process Automation v1.0.0  TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved Page 48 of 61 4.2.4. Process Prediction The process discovery can be extended with information to predict the completion time of running instances. By replaying event logs one can build predictive models, i.e., for the different states of the model particular predictions can be made. For example, a predictive model learned by replaying many cases could show that the expected time until completion after enabling is X hours. In the databased industrial process prediction practice, there are multiple classification strategies for the databased industrial process prediction techniques, in which three aspects are the most commonly considered, e.g., data featurebased methods, timescale based, and the prediction reliabilitybased. For each of the characteristics of predicting modeling, there are commonly used prediction techniques which include the time seriesbased methods, the factorbased methods, the prediction intervals construction methods, and the granularbased long term prediction methods. In network operations, there are many scenarios where reliable time prediction is beneficial to service providers especially when it comes to enhancing the customer experience through effective customer complaint handling. For example, when a customer calls in the contact center to make a complaint on VoLTE service quality, the Customer Complaint handling agent would be able to response to the customer with an expected service quality recovery time through the reliable time prediction modeling 4.3. Process Mining Model for AN Levels Process mining model that connects the data science and process science in providing process transparency to the Autonomous Operation framework. The process mining model optimizes business outcomes and drives business value in accelerating the zero touch operation journey. AO Maturity Model assessment provides a means to establish the asis capability maturity level which is classified into 6 levels. Apart from a few distinct characteristics that describes each autonomous network level ANL, the 6level ANL varies between level of maturity by the degree of manmachine collaboration. The question is that is there an objective approach to determine the degree of manmachine collaboration and consequently classifying the ANL the operation is at. The process mining discovers an endtoend process model from the event logs. For the manmachine collaboration analysis, this guide will only be focusing on the common trace of the process flow and leaving the exceptional trace for non conformance analysis. Common trace of the process model can be easily identified through the event data size and behavior. For the mapping of the process model to the ANL analysis, only the common trace will be considered. The endtoend process lifecycle can be divided into 5 stages namely intent, aware, analysis, decision, and execution. Based on the time stamp of the event data transits from one activity to the next, one can quickly deduce if the operation is manual effort, automated or people assisted by system. GB1042A Objective Approach to AOMM for ANL Process Automation v1.0.0  TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved Page 49 of 61 Figure 43 Mapping of Process Mining Replay to ANL Take for example the troubletoresolution process model replayed on the process mining map, we can gather from the diagram that the activity from alarm generate to trouble ticket create took only 5 mins 25s. The task between those two activities will include alarm compression, alarm correlation and trouble ticket create. Given the amount of effort in processing the fault management, it is undoubtedly to conclude that the fault management process is automated. This means that the operation would have been equipped with a system to be aware of the network equipment details which include the alarm type and classification collected from the EMS. The analysis of the alarm compression, cross domain correlation and root caused analysis has been automated through predefined rules and policy. At the Decision stage on problem management and Execution stage on problem resolution, the duration from one activity to the next took about one hour plus respectively. One can conclude that the two stages are primarily manual driven. There is room for process optimization through automation at those two stages.

Assessing and Measuring Values of Autonomous Operations Figure 51 Capabilities and attributes of Autonomy To assess and measure the values of autonomous operations, it is important to understand the capabilities and the respective attributes that autonomous operations should be equipped with. Autonomous Operations involve the ability to automate, to adapt to dynamic environments, and to selfgoverning without much human intervention. Autonomous operation is about building capabilities on automation that learns and adapts to dynamic environments and evolves as the environment around it changes. The autonomous system will learn from an increasing data set faster, and eventually more reliably in decisionmaking under an evolving and nondeterministic environment, than what would be reasonable for a human. Autonomous Operations in the automation spectrum requires a complex mix of advanced technologies such as AI and ML in combination with organization design and process changes. There is no doubt that autonomous operations will bring great value to an organization that is worth the investment. Investment in technology to build capabilities in realizing business benefits needs to be justified. The values of building the autonomous operation capabilities could be assessed through welldefined use cases and measured by a set of operational metrics.

Use Cases in the Catalyst Use Case Background Operator XYZ is the market leader in the country, serving over 50 million subscribers. The company provides voice, data, video and digital services to consumers, enterprise and home customers. Operator XYZ has embarked on digital operation transformation as part of their strategy to achieve their business objectives to lead NPS and reduce annual operating expenses by 20. In preparation for the 5G launch, Operator XYZ is retiring the 3G networks to free up spectrum for 5G networks. VoLTE service subscription is expected to grow in 10 folds. VoLTE service quality will have a direct impact on customer experience. Operator XYZ is embarking on zero touch operation journey through leveraging technology and building intelligent operation capabilities to drive autonomy. A stepbystep guide to the identification and capability development through the use of AOMM assessment, process mining model and Value Operation Framework VOF can be applied Stage 1 Assessment and Planning Step 1 Assessment of asis maturity level through Process Mining and Discovery Workshop The asis maturity level will be carried out with a combination of process mining and discovery workshop. The SOC and NOC process discovered from the event logs provides event data throughout an endtoend process model. Finding from the process map can be summarized as follows Intent Aware Analysis Decision Execution Duration  1 hr 42 mins 27 mins 1 hr 2 mins 1 hr 13mins Autonomous Network Level 1.X P No API implemented P System assisted in general service monitoring. Aware of VoLTE service degrade through customer complaint P P P System assisted to recover service quality P People S System To assess the asis maturity level with only the process map is not sufficient. The assessment must be accompanied by the ANL characteristics and the AOMM tool to distinctly determine the maturity level. Details on the pain points and the operation effort required could be filled in during the discovery workshop. GB1042A Objective Approach to AOMM for ANL Process Automation v1.0.0  TM Forum 2023.
