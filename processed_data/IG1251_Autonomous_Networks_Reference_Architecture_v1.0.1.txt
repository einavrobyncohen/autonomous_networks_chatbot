# 1. Overview

This guide describes a reference architecture for Autonomous Networks (AN) that can be used to provide guidance on the development of solution architectures for intelligent automation and autonomy within CSP operations. It is not an implementation architecture and as such does not reference specific technologies. This reference architecture builds on the more technical architecture IG1230, which describes the general concepts and principles behind autonomous networks IG1230. This guide prescribes the precise AN Framework scope underpinning the principles, the end-to-end requirements of such an industry reference architecture. The reference architecture provides recommended structures and integrations of autonomous platforms, services, and domains to form a mature AN solution. The reference architecture embodies accepted industry best practices (from TM Forum and other SDOs) and recommends the intent and control loop mechanisms for self-management capabilities. 1. 1 Guide Structure Table 1 Guide Structure  Section Description 1 Overview Describes the scope and terminology used within the AN Reference

# Networks

A set of network and software platforms that can sense its environment and adapting its behavior accordingly with little or no human input.

# Network Levels

(Or simply AN Levels) describe the level of autonomic capability in a given operational workflow or for an autonomous domain (L0 to L5). Autonomous Network Levels identify contextual autonomous capability. Also less formally referred to as autonomy levels. Control loop Control loops are used to enable autonomous systems to adapt their behavior to respond to changes in user needs, business goals, or environmental conditions. Intent Intent is the formal specification of all expectations including requirements, goals, and constraints given to a technical system.

# Domain

Serves as the basic unit that can fulfill closed-loop automation of specific network operations. An autonomous domain is a set of systems or platforms that is capable of intervention. The autonomous domain does this by realizing self-management capabilities using a closed control loop mechanism, using four key phases: awareness, analysis, decision-making autonomous behavior (e. g. , resolve tasks, adhere to objectives) without manual human, and execution. An autonomous domain is a logical construct that provides an administrative governance boundary that defines the scope of the encapsulated autonomous behavior.

# Platform

An autonomous platform is a system or agent with the ability to complete a task without human intervention, using behaviors resulting from the interaction of software with the external environment. Tasks or functions executed by a platform or distributed between a platform and other parts of the system, may be performed using a variety of behaviors, which may include reasoning and problem identification. In this guide the term Platform is preferred over system notwithstanding the latters ubiquity. The platform term is not used in the software architecture sense of the term where a platform provides a foundational set of software services for a product. Table 2 above lists the key terms using the AN technical architecture guide as source IG1230. IG1251 Autonomous Networks Reference Architecture v1. 0. 1  TM Forum 2022. All Rights Reserved.

Page 12 of 36 2 Architectural Principles 2. 1 Introduction Architectural principles define the underlying general rules and guidelines for the use and deployment of resources and assets across the enterprise. They reflect a level of consensus among the various elements of the enterprise and form the basis for making future decisions. The overall design objective of autonomous networks is to enable end-to-end autonomous network operations for telecom services, including business operations, service operations, and resource operations, in a multi-domain, multi-vendor environment. This section defines a set of architectural principles (see Figure 2-1) to guide the autonomous networks reference architecture. These principles guide the design of the system capabilities required to achieve the desired autonomy levels within autonomous domains and autonomous networks. Figure 2-1 Architectural Principles 2. 2 Core Architectural Principles 2. 2. 1 Principle 01: Decoupled Operational Layers supporting Operational

# Flexibility

The overall architecture should comply with the layered architecture pattern, the autonomous networks architecture is separated into three layers, business operations layer, service operations layer, and resource operations layer. Each layer runs in self-operating mode and hides the details of domain implementation, operations and the functions within the domain to the consumers. 2. 2. 2 Principle 02: Intent-driven, Open Interfaces Each autonomous domain (at any of the three operational layers) of Autonomous Networks should expose standardized interfaces. Where appropriate those interfaces should now be intent- driven to provide simplified interaction capabilities for upper-layer services through these open APIs. 01: Decoupled operations layers for operational flexibility 02: Intent-driven, open interfaces 03: Closed Loop

IG1251 Autonomous Networks Reference Architecture v1. 0. 1  TM Forum 2022. All Rights Reserved. Page 13 of 36 2. 2. 3 Principle 03: Closed Loop Automation Automation uses closed loop mechanisms to assure service experience by completing workflow steps but also continuously adapting to ensure goals and objectives are met. The control loop adjusts and adapts itself (through the decision cycle sages of Awareness, Analysis, Decision, Execution IG1230), keeping the system in the desired state without any intervention from outside of a particular loop cycle. 2. 3. 4 Principle 04: Endogenous Intelligence Local knowledge, or endogenous (from within) intelligence, applied locally is a core principle for the internal models of autonomous domains and network elements. More real-time sensing components and AI inference capabilities are introduced to both autonomous domains and network elements to improve observability or digital awareness of resources, services, and surrounding environments. This in turn, enables data sources to have edge intelligence capabilities such as perception analysis and decision execution more locally. For example, AI models could be trained on the cloud and injected into the network through cloud-based collaboration to implement local inference. 2. 3. 5 Principle 05: Single Domain Autonomy The autonomy and independence of a domain is a core principle of AN. , i. e. , each individual or single domain is itself an autonomous domain. It is the independence and self-governing capability of a domain that gives the AN architecture its Lego block appearance. The autonomous domain is an atomic unit with autonomous capabilities in the autonomous network architecture IG1230. Individual autonomous domains focus on network technologies, abstract network capabilities, and simplify OSS integration. 2. 3. 6 Principle 06: Cross Domain Collaboration In the AN framework, each domain is autonomous, but domains must also collaborate in the following aspects: i. end-to-end services need to be coordinated between autonomous domains. In the reference architecture practice, administrative domains may have a hierarchical structure, and cross-domain service management may manage end-to-end services across multiple autonomous domains, and coordinate between administrative domains through orchestration. ii. domains may federate with neighbors, allow upper layer domain only dispatch intent based request without elaborate details which could be coordinated between lower domains by themselves. iii. aggregation of resource domains may happen for administrative or management purpose. The administrator may merge part of the operations of several domains in a converged spot, arrange unified planning, operation tasks, etc. IG1251 Autonomous Networks Reference Architecture v1. 0. 1  TM Forum 2022. All Rights Reserved. Page 14 of 36 2. 3. 7 Principle 07: Supports interactions between Autonomous Domains of different Autonomy Levels Autonomous Domains of different levels have different network autonomy capabilities and corresponding interfaces, the interactions between domains of different levels should be allowed from architecture perspective, and so is the evolution (L0 to L5) of each domain. The runtime within domains is always dynamic as situations and requirements change during operations, so the autonomy levels supported may also change depending on the capability or competence of the autonomous domain. IG1251 Autonomous Networks Reference Architecture v1. 0. 1  TM Forum 2022. All Rights Reserved. Page 15 of 36 3 Architecture Requirements 3. 1 Introduction This section defines requirements applicable to the autonomous networks reference architecture framework. Architecture requirements are derived from the scenarios and requirements described in TM Forum IG1230 and IG1230A. 3. 2 General Requirements The following architectural requirements inform the level of detail and scope that a reference architecture for AN requires. As such, the specific constraints or goals of the architecture are articulated in the form of requirement objectives ( see tables 4 and 5 below). Table 4 General Architectural Requirements Req Requirement ARC-001 The autonomous networks reference architecture shall separate the system into three layers, business operations layer, service operations layer, and network operations layer. ARC-002 The autonomous networks reference architecture shall support four closed control loops, business operations layer closed control loops, service operations layer closed control loops, and network operations layer closed control loops, and end to end closed control loops. ARC-003 The autonomous networks reference architecture shall support the hierarchical autonomous domain. ARC-004 Each architecture layer should have its own AI capabilities. ARC-005 No waste - intelligent use of basic resources. The world is essentially a closed system regarding resources, and thus their usage should be minimized, and they should be recycled for sustainability. In short, the goals of AN are to affect the top and bottom lines of an operator, namely, to enable simplification and achieve operator opex cost reduction while at the same time providing a significantly better service fit for end-consumers of AN and thereby increase operator revenues. The architectural requirements in Table 4 list the former, i. e. , operational requirements while Table 5 below lists the latter, i. e. , the end-customer experience requirements of the vertical ecosystem. IG1251 Autonomous Networks Reference Architecture v1. 0. 1  TM Forum 2022. All Rights Reserved. Page 16 of 36 Table 5 AN Consumer Requirements ANC-001 Autonomous Networks should include customer-facing Interfaces. Expose interfaces (APIs) to customers, allowing them to control services at a much lower cost ANC-002 Autonomous Networks service capabilities should be Self-Service where customer has direct control of services. Services autonomously adapt to customer intent. Customers can adapt services themselves, without sending orders / tickets / or having phone calls. This also applies to Partnering in operations themselves. This allows multiple autonomous domains and platforms to work together to deliver overall business operations. ANC-003 Autonomous Networks should provide the ability to have On-demand delivery  that is where services when required, can be flexibly scaled-up or scaled-down. Services can be autonomously turned on and off as needed. ANC-004 Autonomous Networks should expose customized end-user Services. Services delivering the correct mix of features for the specific vertical use case ANC-005 Ecosystem offerings: Autonomous Networks should provide CSPs need business platforms that can facilitate better interworking with ecosystem partners to deliver packaged offerings to the Vertical Consumer or AN Consumers. ANC-006 The ease of consumption and integration into end-customers business must be a requirement for an autonomous network and for the touchpoints within the business operations layer. See Service Consumability in IG1229 Guiding Principles for more on this term. ANC-007 The Autonomous Network should include the ability to operate with external regulation 3. 3 Autonomous Domain Requirements Table 6 Autonomous Domain Requirements Req Requirement DOM- 001 The autonomous domain should support operation in an independent and self- operating mode. DOM- 002 The autonomous domain should support Intent-driven API, hides internal functions and implementation details, and providing intent verification and reporting capabilities. DOM- 003 Autonomous Domains should be able to operate in Isolation mode when other systems are not resilient to failure DOM- 004 Autonomous Domains should be designed for uncertainty or unexpected situations. Decision-making is still required in scenarios that are unforeseen. DOM- 005 Autonomous Domains should be clear on what levels of autonomy are supported, what capabilities are supported and in what situations. DOM- 006 The knowledge base used by Local Intelligence in an Autonomous Domain should be deployed locally. DOM- 007 Autonomous Domains can be either atomic or composite. Atomic here refers to its ability to operate internally as an independent functional block. Composite domains are the result of coupling particular domains together to form a functional composite where there are dependencies on the contained domains within the composite. IG1251 Autonomous Networks Reference Architecture v1. 0. 1  TM Forum 2022. All Rights Reserved. Page 17 of 36 Req Requirement DOM- 008 Autonomous Domains are federatable  i. e. , can enable operations management through negotiations composed of multiple autonomous domains. It should be possible to connect any implementation of the autonomous domain to all others that were independently developed, in a federated structure, to allow the sharing of appropriate information and workflows between them. IG1251 Autonomous Networks Reference Architecture v1. 0. 1  TM Forum 2022. All Rights Reserved. Page 18 of 36 4 AN Reference Architecture 4. 1 Architecture Overview 4. 1. 1 Introduction This section defines the reference architecture for Autonomous Networks as i. a capability-based layered architecture ii. that is project, market and vendor-agnostic, and does not prescribe any specific tools or technologies iii. an architecture that enables modular and incremental implementations The autonomous networks reference architecture is based on the layered-architecture design pattern. Functional blocks within the layered architecture are organized into three operational layers. The layers are decoupled and evolved independently and interact with each other through prescribed reference points that detail the logical communications required between two layers. For the subsystem architecture of each layer, a service-based architecture is used to support architecture flexibility and scalability. The autonomous networks architecture defines a group of logical building blocks, called autonomous domains that construct the overall logical architecture of the autonomous network. This service-based architecture provides the requisite modularity of the framework using autonomous domains where domains can be deployed from a variety of sources and suppliers. Domains can be interconnected using interfaces defined at the relevant reference points. 4. 2 Reference Architecture 4. 2. 1 AN Reference Architecture Diagram Figure 4-1 depicts the TMF AN Reference Architecture that describes a layered yet composable framework for autonomous operations. It emphasizes and echoes all of core architectural principles outlined in Chapter 2. Operational layers are fully decoupled (Reference points I1, I2, I3). Open interfaces are used at all integration points between domains with intent-driven interfaces being recommended at I and F reference points. Intelligence is also layered and distributed closest to the doer the functional block that executes an action, i. e. , Intelligence is decentralized and localized within its own domain. This is the approach that best suits fast1 decision-making adaptive control loops. Autonomy is maintained within these logical units of management, namely Autonomous Domains. Complexity is encapsulated with these constructs to compartmentalize the capabilities so that the AN can be assembled from multiple federated domains horizontally and vertically. 1 What ETSI GANA terms fast control loops IG1251 Autonomous Networks Reference Architecture v1. 0. 1  TM Forum 2022. All Rights Reserved. Page 19 of 36 Figure 4-1 AN Reference Architecture Note that Figure 4-1Error Reference source not found. shows domains at a single layer for simplicity but these building blocks repeat at all three layers. Autonomous Domain C is shown as an exploded view of the autonomous domain, illustrating some of the inner functions that comprise a domain. Domain C and Domain B and Domain A all cooperate in a federated manner (using F3 in the figure above) but federation applies to all three operational layers. The Service Operations layer achieves a cross-domain collaboration of the Domains A, B, C to provide end- to-end coordination of all of those resource operation domains. The blue dashed rectangle for Autonomous Domain C (Detailed) shows the mechanisms and functions that embody an Autonomous Domain. 1. Operational Layers are a logical construct that organizes platforms along three distinct horizontal axes namely Business, Service, and Resource Operations. 2. Autonomous Domains are also a logical construct that group particular platforms2 into a coherent domain of autonomy. We call these platforms autonomous platforms. 3. An Operational Layer can encompass the operations provided by multiple autonomous platforms. 4. An Autonomous Domain can comprise of multiple autonomous platforms. 5. An Autonomous Domain can comprise of autonomous platforms from multiple operational layers. 4. 3 Autonomous Domain 4. 3. 1 Autonomous Domain Definition An Autonomous Domain is an operational management domain that defines the scope of encapsulated autonomous behavior IG1230. It is the building block (i. e. , unit) of autonomous 2  Platform and Domain are specific terms in TM Forum described in TR255. The semantics of these terms have been respected in the ANF definitions. IG1251 Autonomous Networks Reference Architecture v1. 0. 1  TM Forum 2022. All Rights Reserved. Page 20 of 36 behavior that when federated together form a complete Autonomous Network. It serves as the basic unit that can fulfill closed-loop automation of specific network operations. An autonomous domain is a set of systems or platforms that is capable of intervention. The autonomous domain does this by realizing self-management capabilities using closed control loop mechanisms, using four key phases: awareness, analysis, decision-making autonomous behavior (e. g. , resolve tasks, adhere to objectives) without manual human, and execution. An autonomous domain is a logical construct that provides an administrative governance boundary that defines the scope of the encapsulated autonomous behavior. 4. 3. 2 Autonomous Domains Building Blocks The dashed red and blue rectangular boxes in Figure 4-2 illustrate how ADs can be assembled to form a hierarchy of platforms using Intent-driven interactions at the vertical (governance) and horizontal (federation) levels. Note that the I1, I2, I3 reference points are reused for communication between two different domains but the reference point is still specific to the operational layer. For example, if you take the scenario of two ADs at the business operations layer, then both ADs are federated using the I1 reference point as I1 is specific to business operations. Similarly, I2 is for service operation interfaces and I3 for resource operations interfaces. The next section describes the federation of domains in more detail. Figure 4-2 Autonomous Domains Building Blocks within the Reference Architecture IG1251 Autonomous Networks Reference Architecture v1. 0. 1  TM Forum 2022. All Rights Reserved. Page 21 of 36 4. 3. 3 Composite Autonomous Domains Autonomous Domains can be either atomic or composite (see Figure 4-3). As stated in an earlier section on Autonomous Domain Requirements, Atomic here refers to its ability to operate internally as an independent functional block. Composite domains are the result of coupling particular domains together to form a functional composite where there are dependencies on the contained domains within the composite. Figure 4-3 Autonomous Domains are composable 1. Autonomous Domains (AD) have well-defined boundaries (dashed3 rectangles). 2. Domains may be atomic (AD1) or composite4 (AD5) (i. e. , composed of two or more ADs) 3. An Autonomous Domain can support multiple layers of the Autonomous network (e. g. , AD6) 4. An entire Autonomous Network could therefore be bounded as a single Autonomous Domain (e. g. , AD7) 4. 3. 4 Federated Autonomous Domains The previous sections emphasize that Autonomous Domains are decoupled vertically (top-to- bottom) using I1, I2, I3 reference points and also how these domains can be federated (horizontally) using the same reference points. Error Reference source not found. shows that the same interfaces are used to realize both the layer decoupling and the federation, i. e. , the vertical and horizontal interactions of Autonomous Domains. That is, the same interfaces are reused at the I and F Reference Points. 3 Any dashed or dotted line or shape in ANF means that the construct is logical and conceptual rather than a physical construct. 4 Refer to IG1230 Section 5. 2. 1 Autonomous Domain is a composite structure. IG1251 Autonomous Networks Reference Architecture v1. 0. 1  TM Forum 2022. All Rights Reserved. Page 22 of 36 Figure 4-4 Domains can be Federated using same Intent Interfaces at I and F Reference Points For completeness, the figure below shows the same approach but for all three operational layers. Figure 4-5 Domains can be federated at all operational layers Federation of domains means autonomous collaboration of platforms across multiple self- governing domains. A federation is a peer-to-peer relationship between two or more parties involved in order to achieve a common goal FED. For example, in a resource operations layer, multiple ADs may be interfaced in a layered, peering, or orthogonal way to combine operational contexts and promote a virtualization of an autonomous network over the physical infrastructure. The benefit of this flexible network architecture is that it scales over time and in a functional way; that is, the network and its operations can extend both horizontally as well as vertically and change over time. This architecture is functionally adaptive and scalable and is the basis for an evolving network that incorporates various self-X capabilities such as self-optimization, self- healing, and self-protection IG1218. These self-X capabilities are realized in individual control loop mechanisms defined within domains and across domains. IG1251 Autonomous Networks Reference Architecture v1. 0. 1  TM Forum 2022. All Rights Reserved. Page 23 of 36 4. 4 Functional Blocks The overall architecture is composed of a set of functional blocks defines across the three operational layers and the framework. The functional blocks realize the behavior required to realize initially Autonomous Domains as building blocks and secondly the other blocks required by platforms to create a coherent reference architecture. The most fundamental abstraction used is the nested, composable nature of domains that when chained together or assembled form an autonomous network. 4. 4. 1 AN Consumer AN Consumer Platforms are the systems where the end-customer interacts with the autonomous network(s). AN Consumer platforms comprise of: 1. CSP Consumers Services (B2C) 2. CSP Services to Enterprises (B2B) 3. CSP Services to Enterprises Customers (B2B2X)

Services may include Unified data modeling, dataset development and platform and data security dataset enhancement, digital network insight, and simulation 4. 5 Reference Points The reference architecture defines nine reference points to identify the communication that must occur between the functional blocks previously defined in the AN framework architecture IG1230. Three of the reference points identify the interactions between the three operational layers of the AN framework, namely business, service, and resource operations. These reference points are vertical in orientation and are termed I1, I2, and I3. Domains within the operational layers can all communicate in a horizontal orientation to achieve a federation, and these are termed F1, F2, and F3. And finally, three reference points in a horizontal orientation connect the operational layers to a Knowledge and Intelligence platform. These are termed K1, K2, and K3. Table 10 AN Reference Points

The TM Forum AN Project team working with the AIOps Initiative team and the TM Forums API, and AI project teams will collaborate to build out a map of the required interfaces at these reference points. 4. 5. 2 Intent-driven Interfaces Operations automation is needed to support the fast deployment requirements of the 5G new services. Operators will need to be more efficient to offer the best possible user experience, with full lifecycle automation of the network and maximum utilization of the network resources. The networks automation relies on an automated closed loop driven by the provided intent. As such, closed loop automation needs to be in each operational layer including the network elements (managed entities) at the resource operations layer, and the cross-domain service operations layer to achieve the goal of network autonomy. Cross-domain collaborative closed loops and single-domain autonomous closed loops coordinate and exchange information with each other by open interfaces. To reduce the integration complexity between the layers, the AN reference architecture requires a simplified open interface between the platforms at the lower layer and its upper layer consumer platforms. The information exchanged through these interfaces will change from the current data-centric and parameter- heavy payloads to an exchange of intents (see 1230 and IG1253. The simplification of the open interfaces, in turn, relies on autonomous network capability in each autonomous domain regardless of what operational layer the domain encompasses. A key capability of intent-driven autonomous systems is to infer the intent of the user, rather than require the end-user to provide detailed instructions. These systems should be able to adapt to the needs of the user and understand their language and learn how to interact with users. An intent interface may be an API with an explicit grammar for intents (other synonyms demands, requirements, expectations, objectives). It may also use a dialog style of interaction, i. e. , a conversational API with intelligent back-and-forth between the owners and handlers of the intent. The nature of this dialog could use an interview style interface in which the handling system requests additional information from the user as needed, to provide clarifications, to provide alternatives, to recommend changes to intent (Intent Negotiation). The I1, I2, I3 reference points include many different communication styles, some traditional mechanisms but also new intent-driven interactions. TMF921 Intent Management API Suite will provide a set of interfaces to support Intent-driven interactions. IG1251 Autonomous Networks Reference Architecture v1. 0. 1  TM Forum 2022.

These SDOs have positioned the TM Forum Autonomous Networks architecture as the top-level architecture for reference and instantiation. The ETSI ZSM group was formed with the goal to accelerate the definition of the end-to-end service management architecture, spanning both legacy and virtualized network infrastructure, to enable automatic execution of operational processes and tasks. ZSM instantiates the services and resource operations layer of autonomous networks architecture as shown in Figure 5-1. Figure 5-1 ETSI ZSM Architecture as the realization of AN RA The E2E Service Management Domains contain management functions and management services that align to the autonomous platforms of TM Forums AN Frameworks Service Operations layer. The ZSM Management Domains contain management functions and management services that align to the autonomous platforms of TM Forums AN Frameworks Resource Operations layer. There inner service closed loop within ZSM architecture conform to the respective inner closed loops of the TM Forums AN Framework. There is a correlation or alignment between both architectures.

Page 29 of 36 6 AN Integration 6. 1 Example of Intent-driven AN Reference Architecture Call Flows Figure 6-1 below shows an overview of the message flows between the key functional blocks of the reference architecture. Intent-driven interactions at the I1, I2, I3 reference points drive the closed control loops within the layers which are informed by localized knowledge with the AN Framework. The detailed flows within the intent management function and the control loop management functions are omitted for clarity and brevity. The important messages are 1, 4 and 7 where message cross the operational layer boundaries. Figure 6-1 E2E Intent-driven Autonomous Network Note that the three Intent interactions (see messages 1, 4, and 7 above) are realized by the forthcoming TMF921 API specification.

Page 30 of 36 6. 2 Example of Call Flows between Autonomous Domains The figure below shows an example of the message flows between the autonomous domains of the reference architecture. Intent-driven interactions at the I1, I2, I3 reference points connect the autonomous domains and create the integration fabric. Many variants of the intent negotiation flow exist and beyond the scope of this guide but described in the Intent in Autonomous Networks guides IG1253. One variant is where message 6) below is sent to the third Intent Management function and it then communicates with Intent Management in fourth AD. Here the Intent Management of the third and fourth Autonomous Domain federate the domains together and each resource operations domain negotiates with the other and then communicates to the cross domain service AD. Figure 6-2 AN Reference Architecture Call Flows (Multiple ADs within single layer) The following section details the main interactions between the functional blocks within the overall reference architecture. A thin slice is examined in the form of the I1, I2, I3 reference points that go from the consumer to network element and back. As such this set of interactions describes the outer customer loop from the AN framework itself. The procedure, as illustrated in Figure 6-3 Autonomous Networks Reference Architecture Illustrated (UML Sequence), consists of the following steps: IG1251 Autonomous Networks Reference Architecture v1. 0. 1  TM Forum 2022.

# Business Intent

1. AN Consumer sends a Business Intent to Intent Management (IM) function at the

# Business Operations layer

2. The Intent Management function requests contextual knowledge based on part of the intent expression content. 3. The Intent Management function handles the intent request by translating the Intent Expression into a directive for a Control Loop Management (CLM) system. 4. The CLM starts at the analysis stage by determining affected contextual data requirements and mines contextual data from the knowledge base. a. Details of the workflow loop connection creation, interactions with the knowledge base, and health checks are omitted. 5. The decision stage then compares characteristics of results with policies and constraints defined for that capability 6. The execute stage sends actions to the managed entity in this layer. 7. An awareness step that monitors the outcome of the action taken completes and the CLM reports back on the outcome 8. The Intent Management function decides to issue a newly generated intent southbound and sends it to a downstream intent management function of the service operations layer (I2)

# Service Intent

9. Steps 10 to 16 are similar to the above steps 2 to 8 17. The Intent Management function sends a resource intent to the Intent Management function defined for an autonomous domain at the resource layer.

# Resource Intent

18. (Steps 18 to 22) The CLM of the Resource Operations layers executes the AADE loop mechanism as steps 2 to 8 above 23. The CLM executes an action on the Network Element (NE) 24. (optionally) Site Intelligence at the Network Element is performed. 25. Data collected from the NE is provided as part fo Awareness stage of control loop 26. Awareness stage is completed and the Intent reporting phase begins 27. The CLM functions responds to the IM function, and 28. The IM sends a intent report to its owner intent caller. 29. This IM at the service operations layers also reports to its owner Busines Intent caller 30. The IM at the business operations layer then reports on teh Intent based on what was the outcome was at the service layer. Note 1: The Awareness, Analysis, Decision-making, Execution (AADE) control loop pattern defined in IG1230 is based on the well-known MAPE-K pattern. For clarity, the individual components and the messages between the four stages are not shown as individual actors in the UML sequence diagrams. Rather, the generalized steps of AADE are shown as part of the CLM lifecycle. Note 2: Many more illustrative UML sequence flows across AN are possible, such as more detailed call flows detailing the use of F reference point interaction to federate domains together, as well as call flows showing the use of K reference points from the local domains to the IG1251 Autonomous Networks Reference Architecture v1. 0. 1  TM Forum 2022.

Page 33 of 36 7 Summary Autonomous does not mean unmanned. Humans are still needed in the operations of Autonomous Networks. However, humans are now on the loop operational supervisors rather than in the loop bottlenecks to automation. Humans are good at providing input to systems  much like a teacher to a student  this is where expert knowledge will be accumulated over time to build human intelligence into autonomous platforms. As more and more systems take on complex tasks autonomously, we can still rely on humans to be there for the tasks that the system cannot handle  this will work to also build the necessary trust we need in autonomous operations in Autonomous Networks. This guide introduces the AN Reference Architecture and provides realization scenarios instantiating the architecture as described. The architecture is defined at a functional level with the identification of external reference points. Three classes of reference points are defined, these are:

# I interactions between operational layers

F interactions between autonomous domains within layers K interactions between automation domains at a given layer and a knowledge and intelligence platform The important interfaces required at each reference point have been defined, with standardization work on intent-driven interfaces and AI closed loop management already underway. A complete implementation of the reference architecture is not simply achieved in one project or iteration but rather can be achieved step-by-step - starting with a single domain at a time and then building cross-domain coordination until you ultimately achieve a full Autonomous Network. The Autonomous Network will be intent-driven, context-aware, and guided by knowledge and intelligence. Autonomous Domains provide the modular building blocks for CSPs to assemble these hierarchical self-governing networks. The development of Self-X capabilities within domains will be expedited by the use of standard reference points/interfaces and standard data models. Hierarchical and programmable closed loop automation architectures with distributed decision-making elements will allow for faster and more accurate automated operations. Federation will allow cross-domain sharing of information among decision elements that will provide better insights on the end-to-end customer experience. More work is planned within the TM Forum to identify and further develop the interface specifications at all the reference points that comprise the AN reference architecture. Real-world CSP uses cases will make use of multiple autonomous domains across the operational layers. AI-enabled software and traditional software will coexist with human operations. The ability to have both single-domain autonomy and cross-domain collaboration will be essential to providing autonomous closed loop management of complex networks and services.
