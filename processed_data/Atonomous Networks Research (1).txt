What is an Autonomous Network 6. The Autonomous Network Framework ANF IG1218F 7. The Autonomous Network Architecture 1 Fundamentals of Networks A network in the context of telecommunications serves as the system that enables devices to communicate with each other. 1.1 Components of a Network There are a number of major components which build a network system First, are the devices called nodes which can be computers, TVs, smartphones, servers, etc. Second, there are protocols which are the rules that dictate that manner by which data is transmitted across the network. Protocols can be thought of as the languages devices must speak in order to understand each other. TO ADD What is the protocol being used at VodafoneZiggo in the context of this project IPTCP Thirdly, there are the connections between the devices nodes known as links. These can be physical cables e.g., fiber or wireless connections e.g., Bluetooth, WiFi. Ethernet cables that connect computers to routers, fiber optic cables delivering internet, or wireless signals from a WiFi router. Forth, there is the data, which is the information being transmitted across the network system text messages, emails, files, etc.. Fifth, are the switches and routers which control the data flow. Switches are the devices that connect multiple nodes within a LAN, and make sure that the data gets to the correct device within the local network. Routers are the devices that direct data between different networks. e.g., a home router is responsible for sending data between the local network and the internet. 1.2 Types of Networks Commented EC1 TCPIP on the internet. Will add more detailed info later HTTPHTTPS FTP used to transfer files between systems. C2 VodafoneZiggo Internal Wireless Networks are networks without no physical cables, by which devices communicate over radio signals. In addition, Local Area Networks WAN covers large areas like cities or countries e.g., the internet. Their purpose is to connect distant networks together to allow for communication across cities, counties, or even the entire globe. Further, Local Area Networks LAN covers a small area, like an office or home. They allow users to share resources for example a printer, and access the internet through a single connection. Last, Metropolitan Area Network MAN is a large network that covers a large space, often connecting several LANs. Their purpose is to serve a larger geographical are than LANs but smaller than WANs, and to provide efficient communication for organizations spread across a city or region e.g., a network that connects different departments or buildings in a university campus. 1.3 Key Concepts in Networking There a number of frequently used concepts in networking which are important to know about. Bandwidth refers to the maximum amount of data that can be transmitted over a network in a given amount of time. Higher bandwidth connection allow for faster internet speeds and the ability to handle more devices or applications like streaming a video or gaming Latency refers to the delay between sending a request and receiving a response over the network. Low latency is important for real time applications like gaming, video conferencing, or controlling IoT devices. 2 Connectivity and Infrastructure 2.1 Fiber vs Coax Fiber uses light to transmit data through glass or plastic cables. It offers faster speeds and greater capacity, suitable for long distances with minimal signal loss. On the other hand, Coax uses electrical signals over copper cables, commonly used for cable TV and broadband internet. Its slower than fiber and more susceptible to interference. Coax is often used in older internet infrastructure, delivering moderate speeds but with more limitations over distance. 2.2 Fixed Networks C2 VodafoneZiggo Internal Fixed networks are wired networks fiber, DSL, cable, that provide stable, high speed internet to stationary locations such as homes and offices. A fixed fiber connection in a home provides consistent, highspeed internet compared to mobile networks that rely on cell towers. 3 Emerging T echnologies 3.1 5G 5G or The 5 th Generation of mobile network technology, providing much faster speeds, lower latency, and the ability to connect many devices simultaneously. For example, 5G enables real time data transmission for autonomous cars, allowing them to communicate with each other and avoid collisions. 3.2 The Internet of Things IoT IoT refers to billions of connected devices that collect and share data over the internet, from home appliances to industrial machinery. Smart thermostats, security cameras, and fitness trackers that collect and send data to apps on your phone. 3.3 Why the Incorporation of 5G and IoT Increase Network Complexity The reason behind why new emerging technologies are causing network complexity is mainly due to increased devices and traffic. 5G enables millions of IoT devices to be connected simultaneously, creating more traffic and requiring smarter network management. 4 Network Management Management in the context of network management refers to the process of ongoing monitoring, controlling, and maintenance of the performance of the network. 4.1 NonAutonomous Network Management Involves work by employees such as administrators and network engineers. They key tasks of these employees include the following 1. Network Configuration configuring network devices e.g., routers, switches in an optimized way based on the needs of the network. This may include, for example, prioritizing certain types of network traffics or setting bandwidth limits. 2. Monitoring using toolssoftware to monitor the status of the network. The monitoring can either be in the means of fixing issues on the spot i.e., as they occur, or by means of identifying potential issues before they occur. 3. Troubleshooting this entails the diagnostic process of issues that have occurred e.g., security attacks, misconfiguration, hardware problems, etc. , by means of C2 VodafoneZiggo Internal manually reviewing system logs and running tests in hopes of identifying the root causes of the issues. 4. Maintenance manually handling regular updates to security, software and hardware in the effort to ensure that everything is running efficiently. 4.1.1 Challenges of NonAutonomous Network Management There are a number of potential issues that arise when the traditional non autonomous network management paradigm is used. The most obvious issue is the likelihood of human error . Like all manual processes, manual network management is prone to mistakes that can cause security issues or network outages if some misconfigurations or other faulty tasks are overlooked. Another challenge of the traditional management paradigm is scalability. As networks grow in their complexity and breadth, it become increasingly challenging and more resourceintensive to manage the network. In other words, as the scale of the network grows, the number of employees required to monitor and manage it grows as well. Finally, when problems in the network occur it can be time consuming to troubleshoot and fix issues when done manually. Troubleshooting can be extremely slow if the network is complex, and, as a result, can create a lot of frustration in both employees as well as with customers. 4.2 Autonomous Network Management Autonomous network management ANM employs Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning tools to automate the management of networks , with minimal to no human intervention. The key features of the autonomous network management paradigm can be identified as the following 1. SelfMonitorization AIpowered systems can monitor the network continuously and in realtime, without requiring constant human supervision. 2. SelfHealing and Self Troubleshooting When problems with the network arise, the autonomous networks can automatically diagnose the underlying cause, and the network will try to recover from failures or repair them on its own. e.g., a router fails. The network then re routs traffic through alternative paths to maintain continuous network service. 3. SelfOptimization the incorporation of AI tools allows to analyze network performance over time, learning from patterns and making adjustments to improve efficiency. e.g., ensuring efficient utilization of resources, optimization of data paths, etc. Commented G2 This is a nice part. This can help us to structure the use cases we have, and the new use cases to know in which are they help us to move towards a level 45 of AN. Maybe a nice idea is to have a slide on this, so we can use when you meet people to give you more information about the network, then for the use cases they have you can have a discussion on where do they fit. C2 VodafoneZiggo Internal 4. SelfSecuring the ability to automatically detect and respond to anomalies relating to security threats, and respond to them in real time. AIbased intrusion detection systems can analyze traffic patterns and block or isolate suspicious activities to protect the network from cyberattacks. 5. SelfConfiguration the ability to selfconfigure based on network conditions. e.g., automatic adjustments to bandwidth for certain services. It also entails that the system will be able to configure new devices that are added to the network with minimal human input. 4.2.1 Advantages of Autonomous Network Management Advantage Explanation Example Predictive maintenance AI can detect potential problems before they become serious. Reduced human error Automation reduces the chance of mistakes that might occur with non  autonomous management, as necessary configurations and adjustments are made based on algorithms that are precise. A network engineer misconfigures a firewall, causing an outage. In an autonomous system, AI handles the configuration, which reduces the chance for mistake. Efficiency and speed AI can identify and mend problems much faster than humans, which in turn reduces downtime and minimizes the impact of issues in the network. If a router in a network fails, an AI system can detect it immediately and re route traffic in seconds, preventing noticeable downtime for customers. Scalability ANs can manage largescale, complex environments more easily, as AI systems can handle vast amounts of data and adapt to changing conditions in realtime. VodafoneZiggo adds hundreds of cell towers to its network. The autonomous system automatically integrates them and optimizes traffic without the need for manual intervention. Cost efficiency Reduces the need for large teams of administrators, which lowers operational costs. VodafoneZiggo automates network management with AI, reducing the need for a large IT team to manually monitor and Commented CE3 Comprehensive explanation and examples for future reference httpswww.sciencedirect.comsciencearticlepiiS266 5917423001630 C2 VodafoneZiggo Internal maintain the network , saving on labor costs. 4.2.2 Challenges of Autonomous Network Management Although there are numerous advantages to embracing an ANM paradigm, there are still some challenges to be accounted for. Firstly, is can result in some security risks, since AN can also open new surfaces for potential attacks. If the system is compromised, it might be a challenge to detect it or stop it quickly. Second, there are some high costs that are entailed within the process of setting up an AN, as it requires investment in AI and automation technologies. Last, it can be complex to both develop and maintain the AI systems that run the ANs. 5 What is an Autonomous Network An Autonomous Network AN is a selfmanaging network that leverages Artificial Intelligence AI, Machine Learning ML, and automation technologies to perform various tasks without human intervention. These tasks include selfconfiguration, self optimization, selfhealing, and selfprotection. The aim of AN is to handle network operations dynamically and efficiently, optimizing performance in realtime based on the constantly changing state of network. 5.1 TM Forums Definition of Autonomous Networks According to TM Forums IGI1218F p.6, autonomous networks are designed to achieve zerotouch operation, which means that the system should operate without the need for manual configuration or intervention from human operators. Instead, AI and closed loop automation continuously monitor the network, analyze data, and execute decisions such as rerouting traffic or adjusting bandwidth allocation. In the TMs Forums framework, zerotouch, zerowait, zerotrouble are the core goals of ANs. There refer to  ZeroTouch the network should autonomously handle routine tasks.  ZeroWait Realtime, immediate responses to network demands.  ZeroTrouble Selfhealing and selfprotective mechanisms that prevent network issues from affecting customers. C2 VodafoneZiggo Internal The role of AI in this context is critical, as the network relies on ML algorithms and real time data analytics to predict and preemptively solve issues, ensuring seamless operation even as demand change. The AI in AN relies on several types of machine learning techniques 1. Supervised Learning This involves training AI models using historical labeled data to predict and optimize network behavior. For example, a model might predict traffic congestion based on previous patterns, allowing the network to re route traffic preemptively. 2. Reinforcement learning In this type of learning, the AI learn by interacting with the network environment. It receives feedback rewards or penalties based on its actions, helping in optimize decisions over time. This is especially useful for adjusting traffic routing in response to realtime network conditions. 5.2 AI Driven SelfX Capabilities ANs possess selfX capabilities, a term used to describe the various selfmanaging function the network can perform autonomously. These include 1. SelfConfiguration the ability to automatically configure network devices such as routers, switches, and virtual machines based on predefined goals. 2. SelfOptimization Continuous adjustments of network parameters to optimize performance metrics, such as latency and energy efficiency. 3. Selfhealing The networks ability to detect and mitigate security threats in real time. 4. Selfprotection The capability to autonomously detect and mitigate security threats in real time. This can be done by using unsupervised learning models that identify anomalous behavior in traffic, such as DDoS attacks. Each of these function is powered by AIdriven automation, which guided by the analysis of data streams from network devices and traffic. For instance, in selfhealing, the AI identifies performance anomalies e.g., failing server and autonomously takes corrective actions, such as rerouting traffic or restarting the server to minimize downtime. 6 The Autonomous Network Framework ANF IG1218F This section covers key insights from the IGI1218F document, providing a comprehensive understanding of the framework needed to build and implement AN in a telecommunications environment. The content in relevant for progressing toward automated network management within VodafoneZiggo. 6.1 Key Elements of ANF Commented EC4 Source Landing AI on Networks An equipment vendor viewpoint on Autonomous Driving Networks Commented EC5 Source Exploring unsupervised Learning with Clustering and Autoencoder to Detect DDoS attack C2 VodafoneZiggo Internal There are 4 relatively independent key elements of ANF. 1. Key Effectiveness Indicators KEIs helps to determine the benefits of enhancing the telecommunications systems with greater autonomy capabilities. 2. Autonomous Network Levels AN Levels The framework establishes six levels of network autonomy, which offer a clear progression pathway toward full network autonomy.  L0 Manual all network operations are manually managed.  L1 Assisted automation handles repetitive tasks, but critical decisions remain manual.  L2 Partial Autonomous automated systems perform predefined tasks based on rules.  L3 Conditional Autonomous the network can adapt to realtime changes without human assistance.  L4 Highly Autonomous AIdriven, the network predicts issues and resolves them proactively.  L5 Fully Autonomous Endtoend automation with minimal to no human intervention. 3. AN Target Architecture detailed in the next section. 4. AN Map This is a roadmap for CSPs to prioritize what areas of the network to automate first.  Serviceoriented focuses on improving customerfacing services.  Networkoriented focuses on automating the physical network routers, switches, etc. 6.1.1 AN L3L4 Characteristics There is now industry consensus that AN Levels are defined based on cognitive closed loop theory and the degrees of a humanmachine division of labor.  6.1.1.1 Cognitive ClosedLoop Theory This theory refers to a system where feedback from the network like data on performance or issues is constantly being processed, and actions are automatically taken to address or improve the situation. The cognitive aspect means that the network isnt just reacting to issues but learning from then over time to predict and prevent problems before they arise. In essence, the network becomes smarter as it operates, and decisions are made automatically in a loop of monitoring, feedback, and adjustment. This closed loop process enables the network to evolve its operations without human intervention, a critical feature in reaching higher levels of autonomy. Commented CE6 This is where we are if I remember correctly Commented G7R6 Correct, we are somewhere between 1 and 3, for some parts we are 1 and some parts maybe 2 or 3. Commented CE8 This is where we want to be in the near future if I remember correctly Commented G9R8 Yes, the aim is between 4 and 5. Commented EC10 Was there a choice made already in this regard Or are we free to choose Commented G11R10 Not sure about this, we probably need to ask Arjan Eeken  he was busy with the Automation roadmap for Fixed Network. Would be nice to have a talk with him. I also know that the GenAI squad is algo thinking about the AN concept but they dont have the network knowledge, so we should take charge of which areas to start, together with them for the feasibility, but we should make a plan on this. we I mean Technology C2 VodafoneZiggo Internal Academic sources discuss the importance of feedbackdriven decision making in both AI and autonomous systems, highlighting that this feedback loop is essential for enabling networks to adjust and selfoptimize over timer, as seen in autonomous systems like selfdriving cars and other AImanaged environments. 6.1.1.2 HumanMachine Division of Labor As networks become more autonomous, the division of tasks between humans and machines shifts. At lower level autonomy L0L1, humans make most decisions, and the network only assists with repetitive or basic tasks. As you progress to higher levels L3L4, the network can handle more complex tasks, such as selfoptimization and predictive maintenance, with little to no human intervention. The division of labor aspect is key to understanding how much control is handed over to the network. At the highest level L5, the network operates fully autonomously, requiring no human input, except in extraordinary circumstances. In academic research, the idea is often referred to as humanautonomy teaming HAT, where both the human and machine share responsibilities, but the machine takes over on more complex and autonomous decisionmaking roles as it becomes more capable. 7 The Autonomous Network Architecture The Autonomous Network Architecture Technical Architecture, as described in GI1230, defines a layered, modular structure that allows the network to be selfgoverning, adaptive, and scalable. It shows the integration of AI, Network Function Visualization NFV, SoftwareDefined Networking SDN, and intentdriven interactions. The architecture enables closedloop automation and fosters autonomous decisionmaking through distributed intelligence. Below, I will break down the key components of the AN architecture and their interplay. 7.1 Autonomous Networks Technical Architecture Layered Model The AN architecture is stratified into three major layers, each responsible for managing different aspects of network operations. 1. Resource Operations Layer this layer is responsible for managing the physical and virtual resources of the network, such as routers, switches, and servers. The resource operation layer works with virtualization technologies like NFV and SDN to provide a flexible and programmable network infrastructure. This layer Commented EC12 Source 1 httpslink.springer.comarticle10.1007s10111020 00637w Source 2 httpsieeexplore.ieee.orgdocument9904673 Commented EC13 Source 1 httpswww.frontiersin.orgjournalspsychologyarticles 10.3389fpsyg.2021.589585full Source 2 httpswww.ncbi.nlm.nih.govpmcarticlesPMC928408 5 C2 VodafoneZiggo Internal interacts closely with the service operations layer to ensure that the network resources align with servicelevel requirements. 2. Service Operations Layer the service operations layer focuses on service orchestration and optimization. This layer ensures that all services meet their servicelevelagreements SLAs. Aidriven service orchestration tools monitor the network in realtime, ensuring that services are delivered efficiently and optimized based on demand. 3. Business Operations Layer the business operations layer aligns network performance with business goals, such as maximizing customer satisfaction, reducing operational costs, or increasing profitability. The AIdriven decision engines in this layer ensure that network services and operations are aligned with the companys broader objectives. 7.1 Autonomous Domains and IntentDriven Interactions One of the core concepts of the AN technical architecture is the division of the network into Autonomous Domains ADs. These domains are selfcontained units that manage specific network functionalities and are governed by a set of policies and rules that dictate their autonomy. AD communicate through intentdriven interfaces, a highlevel abstraction model where network operators express desired outcomes which are then translated by the AI system into network actions. Each AD operates independently but cooperates with other domains to deliver endtoend services crossdomain integration. ADs encapsulate various network operations, such as routing, traffic management, and security, while optimizing these based on realtime analysis and intent. 7.1.1 IntentBased and ZeroTouch Operations IntentBased Networking IBN plays a key role in autonomous networks by allowing operators to define high level goals, known as intents, rather than configuring the network manually. These intents are abstract, meaning that operators do not need to specify the exact steps to achieve their goals. Instead, the networks AI translates these intents into actionable commands that align with the networks objectives, ensuring zerotouch operations where tasks are performed automatically without human involvement. IBN is closely tied to the closed loop, since the closed loop allows the network to constantly evaluate its performance against the defined intent. For example, if an operators intent is to minimize latency for a particular service , the AI will dynamically adjust the network parameters and configurations to meet this goal by rerouting traffic or prioritizing resources. This capability is particula rly important as C2 VodafoneZiggo Internal networks evolve towards L4 and L5 autonomy, where the system can fully execute and optimize tasks across multiple domains and services without human intervention. 7.1.2 Intent Handling The AI system within an AN process highlevel intents provided by network operators or users. These intents define goals that the network must achieve autonomously. The intent API facilitates communication between different layers and functions of the network and by ensuring the intents are translated into actions. 7.2 AI and ClosedLoop Automation ClosedLoop automation is at the heart of ANs, allowing the network to continually optimize its operations by feeding real time data back into AI models. This process is autonomous and ongoing, enabling the network to detect inefficiencies, faults, or potential risks and adjust configurations accordingly. For example, in response to unexpected surge in traffic, the network can automatically scale or adjust routing paths to balance the load, ensuring minimal disruption. As noted in TM Forums IG1230, closed loop automation involves several stages awareness, analysis, decision making, and execution of network optimization. AI systems are responsible for analyzing data from various network components, predicting failures, and adjusting the network in real time. This process operates autonomously across multiple layers of the network, including both service and resource levels. 1. Awareness In this stage, telemetry data from network elements e.g., switches, routers is collected in real time, including metrics such as bandwidth, latency, and fault logs. 2. Analysis AI models analyze this data to identify anomalies, optimize traffic, or detect potential failures. Techniques like ML are used to predict future network conditions. 3. DecisionMaking Based on the analysis, AI determines the optimal actions to take in order to maintain or improve network performance. This could include actions like rerouting traffic or allocating additional bandwidth. 4. Execution The network implements these decisions automatically through its management systems, reconfiguring itself without human oversight. 7.3 Network Function Virtualization NFV Network Function Virtualization NFV decouples network functions from dedicated hardware devices and runs them as virtual instances on standardized hardware. This enables the network to dynamically instantiate or terminate network functions based on current demand, providing greater scalability and flexibility. Commented C14 Further explanation What Is Network Functions Virtualization NFV  IBM C2 VodafoneZiggo Internal In AN, NFV allows the network to quickly deploy, and scale services based on realtime demand. For example, if traffic to a particular service increase, the network can instantiate additional virtual instances of network functions to handle the increased load. 7.4 SoftwareDefined Networking SDN SDN is another foundational technology in AN, providing the programmability required for AIdriven decision making. SDN separates the control panel from the data plane, allowing network operators to control traffic flows programmatically through a centralized controller. In AN, SDN enables realtime network adjustments by interacting with AIdriven decision engines. The centralized control plane provides a global view of the network, allowing the AI system to dynamically reroute traffic, allocate bandwidth, and optimize resources based on realtime data. 7.5 AN Target Architecture The AN target architecture defines a holistic framework for the future of selfmanaging networks. By decomposing the network into Autonomous Domains ADs and integrating AI decisionmaking, closedloop automation, and intentdriven interfaces, this architecture enables a fully autonomous, scalable, and adaptive network infrastructure. AI models, in combination with intentbased management and cross domain collaboration, provide the tools necessary for achieving network autonomy. 7.5.1 Core Elements of the AN Target Architecture The components of the AN target architecture work together to reduce complexity and by decomposing the network into Autonomous Domains ADs. 1. IntentDriven Interfaces the architecture uses intentbased networking IBN to abstract operational goals from detailed configurations. Operators provide a highlevel objective, which AI translates into specific technical actions. Intent is defined and executed autonomously through machine learning models embedded within the network. 2. ClosedLoop Automations this is the core of the architecture AI systems continuously monitor, analyze and adjust network behavior. 8 Knowledge and Intelligence in AN Technical Architecture Commented C15 Academic paper talking about SDN in IBN Intentdriven autonomous network and service management in future cellular networks A structured literature review arxiv.org Commented C16R15 section 2.5 C2 VodafoneZiggo Internal AI allows networks to analyze vast amounts of realtime data, predict network behavior, and autonomously adjust configurations. 8.1 AI Usage Modes 1. Development Mode Sandbox a sandbox is a controlled and isolated testing environment where AI models can be trained, tested, and validated before being deployed to a live network. This mode ensures that AI models are thoroughly evaluated without impacting the live system. In the context of ANs, the sandbox often exists within the cloud, which provides computational resources and for tasks like model training. a. Apache Spark Apache Spark is a powerful opensource data processing engine designed for largescale data analytics. It allows for distributed computing, meaning tasks that are broken down and processed across multiple machines simultaneously. In AI development, Spark is often used for training models on large datasets in parallel, improving scalability and efficiency. b. Hadoop Apache Hadoop is another opensource framework that stores and processes large datasets across clusters of computers. Hadoops MapReduce programming model beraks down tasks into smaller components and distributes them across many machines, making it useful for AI applications that need to handle massive amounts network data, such as those generated by ANs. 2. Runtime Mode Production after an AI model has been trained and validated in development mode, it moves to runtime mode, where it is deployed in the live network. In runtime, AI models operate in realtime to make decisions, optimize resources, and enable closedloop automation. 8.2 Layered Intelligence in AN The AN architecture applies layered intelligence across different network layers to ensure seamless coordination between business operations, service orchestration, and resource management. This multilayered approach allows each layer of the architecture to operate semiautonomously while contributing to the broader systems selfmanagement goals.  Cloud  AI Layer the cloud acts as the central hub for AI model training and storage. It provides the necessary computational resources and data storage to train complex AI models using large datasets. o Cloud computing provides an ondemand availability of computing resources over the internet, allowing organizations to store data and run applications without managing physical servers. C2 VodafoneZiggo Internal  Service Management Layer  AI in this layer, AIdriven systems manage service orchestration and SLA Service Level Agreement enforcement, continuously adjusting services based on network conditions and demand. AI inference engines deployed at this layer process data flows and make decisions that optimize network performance. o AI Inference Inference refers to the process of applying trained AI models to new data in order to make predictions or decisions. In the AN context, inference engines analyze network data in realtime, helping adjust configurations based on current network conditions.  Network Element NE Layer  AI NE are individual hardware or software components in a network, such as routers, switches, or firewalls. Embedding AI into these elements allows them to make decisions locally, reducing the need for centralized control and enabling faster responses to network changes. o Edge Computing processing data at the edge of the network, closer to the data source e.g., network elements, rather than sending it to a centralized cloud. In ANs, edge computing reduces latency by allowing AI models to make decisions at the local level, enhancing the speed and responsiveness of the network. 8.3 Developing and Using AI Models AI models undergo a full lifecycle, from data preparation and model training to realtime inference and continous optimization. This ensures that AI systems remain effective as network conditions evolve. 1. Data Service data service manages the lifecycle of data, from collection to processing, ensuring the quality and integrity of the data used for training. This includes data governance, which ensures data is handled in a way that meets regulatory requirements, such as data privacy and security. 2. Model Training AI models are trained using large datasets, often throught frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. During training, feature engineering is used to extract important features from the raw data, making it easier for AI models to learn from the data. 3. Inference Framework after training, AI models are deployed into the live network where they perform inference. 4. Standarization of AI Models To ensure scalability and consistency across the network, AI models need to be standardized. This means ensuring that models are interoperable across different platforms and environments e.g., cloud and and edge. 8.4 Relevant AI Technologies for AN Scenarios C2 VodafoneZiggo Internal Different AI technologies are applied depending on the specific needs of the network, depending on the specific needs of the network, including managing traffic, detecting anomalies, and optimizing performance. 1. Automated Machine Learning AutoML AutoML automates the process of selecting, training, and optimizing machine learning models. This is particularly useful in ANs, where rapid model deployment is needed to handle dynamic network conditions. 2. Transfer Learning Transfer Learning allows AI models trained in one context to be adapted to another with minimal additional training. This is useful in Telecoms, where models trained on one type of network can be applied to another without starting from 0. 3. Federated Learning models are trained across multiple devices without centralized data, allowing for data privacy and local optimization. This technique is particularly useful in ANs, where data privacy is a concern. 4. Knowledge Graph represents relationships between entities, such as network elements, users, and services. AI uses this graph to infer patterns and relationships between different entities. In telecom networks, it can be used to map out connections between devices, services, and users, allowing AI to make more informed decisions. 8.5 AI in Common Telecom Use Cases 8.5.1 Perception and Prediction Perception and prediction involves the use of AI to analyze network data and forecast future states, enabling proactive decisionmaking. One prominent example is energysaving techniques in Base Transceiver Stations BTS, where AI models predict traffic patterns and adjust operations to reduce energy consumption.  Base Transceiver Station BTS critical component in wireless communication networks responsible for transmitting and receiving signals between mobile devices and the network. Reducing the energy consumption of BTS components, such as carrier amplifiers, is essential for lowering operational costs and improving sustainability. In the case of BTS energysaving, Long ShortTerm Memory LSTM neural networks are commonly employed. LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network RNN, specifically designed to handle timeseries data, making it ideal for predicting traffic patterns. By analyzing historical traffic data such as the Physical Resource Block PRB utilization, the LSTM model can predict future traffic loads. This prediction allows the network to configure energysaving strategies, such as turning off or reducing the power of BTS carrier amplifiers during lowtraffic periods. C2 VodafoneZiggo Internal  PRB units of bandwidth used in wireless communication systems to allocate resources to users. Managing PRB traffic efficiently is crucial for optimizing network performance and reducing energy consumption in BTS systems. 8.5.2 Detection and Identification AI is widely used in telecoms for fault detection and root cause analysis, which are critical for maintaining network reliability and reducing operational costs. The complexity of modern telecommunications networks makes it difficult to manually identify the root cause of issues such as base station power failures. AI technologies like frequent text mining, clustering, and knowledge graphs are employed to automate the identification of faults and determine their root causes.  Frequent Item Mining this is a data mining technique used to identify patterns that frequently occur in large datasets. In the context of telecom, frequent item mining helps identify common faults or failures that tend to cooccur in the network. For example, if a base station power failure often leads to certain transmission errors, frequent item mining can help pinpoint the most likely causes.  Clustering Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique used to group similar fata points together. In telecommunications, clusteringg is applied to group network elements or fault occurrences that exhibit similar behaviors. This helps in narrowing down potential causes of a network issue based on patterns of similar faults across multiple network nodes.  Knowledge Graphs 8.5.3 Control Optimization Refers to AIs ability to finetune network parameters to maximize resource utilization and enhance service delivery. In complex environments like 5G networks, manual optimization of network parameters is timeconusming and inefficient. AI systems, using RL and deep learning, can quickly explore an evaluate different antenna configurations in real time. Instead of manually adjusting settings, AI finds the optimal combination of parameters that maximize signal stregnth, minimize interference, and enhance overall quality of service. 8.5.4 Process Optimization Process optimization in telecoms is focused on automating repetitive tasks that would typically require a human intervention, such as network maintenance and operations. Robotic Process Automation RPA is a key AIdriven technology in this area.  Robotic Process Automation RPA involves configuring software robots to mimic human actions and interact with data systems in the same way a human C2 VodafoneZiggo Internal operator would. In telecoms, RPA is used to automate business processes, such as managing customer requests, billing, and troubleshooting network issues.  AIOps Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations AIOps refers to the application of AI in IT operations, combining multiple AI capabilities such as machine learning, natural language processing, and RPA to enahnce the automation of complex processes in network management. RPA tools automate tasks like customer ticket resolution, network monitoring, and maintanance scheduling. By leveraging machine learning models, RPA can predict when network components need maintenance or automatically resolve common network issues. AIOps takes this a step further by integrating AI across multiple processes, such as KPI anomaly detection, log anomaly detection, and fault detection.
