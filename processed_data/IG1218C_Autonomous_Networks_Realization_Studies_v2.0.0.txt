This document provides the common approach and reference solutions from leading CSPs, to serve the purpose of helping CSPs develop their strategies and priorities during the realization of Autonomous Network. IG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0  TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 11 of 105 1. Introduction The Telecom industry has been precise on the vision and the business and operation drivers for Autonomous Networks. The market demands it, the CSPs need it, and previously insurmountable technology difficulties now have feasible solutions thanks to AIML. Now is the time to focus on how to realize Autonomous Networks. Autonomous Networks is not just about enabling technologies nor a shortterm project. Realizing Autonomous Networks is equivalent to constructing a brand new social technical system inside CPS that can deliver the Autonomous Networks zerox experience and selfx capabilities vision. The new system will redefine all aspects of CSP function to become more agile, efficient, scalable, humanfriendly, partner friendly, and userfriendly. Strategic planning and tactics are essential to ensure success by balancing multiple key factors shortterm and longterm ROI, human and machine coordination, swift progressing and safety, the organizational transformation from Telco to TechCo while maintaining current daily operations. Many CSPs have already started the Autonomous Network journey. While each CSP has its priorities and strategies, there are common patterns that we can identify through the lens of the Autonomous Network framework. This document specifies common challenges and general approach to realizing Autonomous Networks and describes reference solutions that various CSPs are engaging. This document version 2.0 is based on the previous version version 1.0 and combines with the latest progress in AN implementation practice by industry partners, especially CSPs. This document demonstrated the implementation of the four key elements of autonomous networks vision and target architecture, grading standards, performance indicators, operation Practice as the core methodology. Gave the best practices of leading CSPs such as China Mobile in promoting selfintelligence networks on a large scale, hierarchical evaluation and selfintelligence ability improvement, and construction and evaluation of effectiveness indicators to promote selfintelligence. The theoretical framework of network implementation methods is becoming mature, providing method guidance and practical reference for more CSPs to carry out AN planning and deployment, and helping CSPs to formulate their strategies and priorities during the realization of ANs. This document summarizes 39 commercial solutions in 4 categories Enable Verticals, Customer Experience, Business Growth, Efficient OM, and Green Energy. Covering 5G to B, cloud network integration, enterprise private networkprivate line, highquality home broadband, DC All highvalue business scenarios such as network energy conservation, covering all network majors such as transmission, IP, mobility, and access, not only show the enthusiasm of the industry to develop selfsmart networks, but also provide the most direct reference case for CSP to carry out application innovation.

Challenges of Largescale Realization As an increasing number of CSPs plan and deploy ANs, challenges are surfacing. TM Forums Autonomous Networks White Paper 3.0 identified six main challenges and offered ideas to address them. But new problems keep emerging, so the six challenges have been expanded in 2022 as follows 1. How to measure the business value and OM effectiveness of ANs Can L3 or L4 ANs help CSPs provide new services and expand the digital markets in various industries How can L3 or L4 improve service quality and experience What benefits can L3 or L4 offer to improve network resource usage, lower OM costs and improve OM efficiency These key problems need to be considered when carriers formulate AN strategies and evolution paths. 2. How to implement a levelbased autonomous closed loop and finally enable agile services and business closed loops The implementation of ANs requires crosslayer collaboration between networks and operations systems, and crossdomain streamlining of core, bearer, transport and wireless domains. How can CSPs develop autonomous capabilities from bottom to top and implement a levelbased autonomous closed loop How can they quickly integrate underlying capabilities to enable agile services How can they facilitate AN construction based on business value in a topdown manner to achieve a business closed loop These problems are yet to be resolved by CSPs. 3. How to develop the L4 target profile for each network domain and set the evolution path What is the L4 target profile of each network domain What new digital services, business models and service capabilities can be provided What are the technical features What is the target architecture What specific technical capabilities need to be developed What new operations changes will emerge What are the evolution paths and how to select them These are the questions to be answered by CXOs of CSPs and all industry partners. 4. How to deploy fullstack AI and leverage the collaboration between cloud based centralized AI and networkbased distributed AI Introducing AI to communications networks in order to upgrade highly complex networks to ultraintelligent systems has become the industry consensus. However, what is the target architecture for ultraintelligent systems Is it a centralized ultraintelligent brain that commands the entire network Or is it an efficient and collaborative distributed cerebellum How will CSPs deploy fullstack AI in a coordinated manner How can they leverage the collaboration between cloud AI and distributed AI The entire industry needs to jointly explore these questions and find winwin answers. 5. How to enable industry partners to collaborate and innovate, build a healthy ecosystem, and upgrade and evolve at the same time The implementation of ANs involves theoretical research and technological breakthroughs in multiple sectors including communications, IT, AI and automation. Many concepts and technologies are still being defined and verified. How can the positioning and collaboration of all parties be standardized How will the sectors strike a balance between return on investment and developing cutting edge technologies How to design a schedule for upgrades and evolution is a challenge that must be overcome. 6. How to establish process mechanisms and develop skills for ANs Tremendous efforts have been made to use machines to equip employees with OM capabilities and transform the troubleshooting mode from ticket forwarding, which is a long process, to device selfhealing or onehop closedloop processing. How will CSPs upgrade employees skills to implement automatic and intelligent IG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0  TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 13 of 105 OM How will they inject OM knowledge, train, and supervise machines in a lowcode manner Answering these questions is key to the successful implementation of ANs. 7. How to establish unified evaluation standards Many CSPs and suppliers have been working on the objectives of L3 and L4 autonomous capabilities. However, due to different methods of evaluation, multiple evaluation scopes and varying degrees of understanding, it is difficult to compare and evaluate the ANL of industry players. Therefore, it becomes necessary to jointly define unified evaluation standards. 8. How to perform systematic planning and deployment It is challenging for CSPs to perform ANL evaluation on all products, services and domains. Plus they must correlate standards at the domain level and promote cloud network operations autonomy for the entire network based on the unified goal, planning and strategies. 9. How to evolve capabilities efficiently It is difficult to build the mapping between ANL evaluation results and effectiveness evaluation results based on business and service objectives. It is also challenging to effectively identify weaknesses of autonomous capabilities, coordinate the autonomous capabilities of the system with those of networkcloud, and adopt agile iteration to evolve to the higher levels of Ans IG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0  TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 14 of 105 3. Method and Practices for AN Realization 3.1. Method Four Key Elements to AN Implementation Implementing Autonomous Networks requires an allaround, systematic and continuous network transformation. TM Forum has aggregated industry best practices and summarized four elements key to AN implementation Creating a vision and target architecture Adopting the AN levels Using effectiveness indicators to measure the business value and service effectiveness of ANs Establishing operations practices to develop automated and intelligent capabilities for networks and support systems efficiency. These elements are expected to help more CSPs plan and implement AN in a faster and more systematic manner. Figure 1 illustrates how the four elements fit together, and a more detailed explanation follows. Figure 1 Four key elements to AN implementation 1. Vision and target architecture  the AN vision and objectives are defined to improve business growth and operations efficiency based on the overall corporate strategy and industry trends for example, business scenarios like computing power network. Based on the live network architecture and running status, key trends for example, 5GAdvanced, cloudnetwork synergy and digital symbiosis are considered to develop a mid and longterm target architecture in order to guide AN construction. 2. AN Levels  CSPs must also adopt generic ANL, domainspecific ANL and the corresponding evaluation methods to fully and objectively measure the ANL. The evaluation process requires setting up baselines and identifying weaknesses to formulate phasespecific objectives and improvement strategies. Then, CSPs can launch technical research and develop innovative applications to meet the autonomous capability requirements at each level. Finally, CSPs can verify the results, optimize strategies in real time and improve resource utilization. 26  Back to Contents  Method and practices for AN evaluation IG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0  TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 15 of 105 3. Effectiveness indicators  it is important to measure the business value and service effectiveness of AN in terms of service growth, customer experience and operations efficiency. The value of these indicators lies in two aspects 1 visualizing and quantifying the effectiveness and benefits of AN evolution and 2 aligning the development of autonomous capabilities with the enterprise strategy and service development trend. Effectiveness indicators are selected based on the ZeroX and SelfX visions. Effectiveness indicators and ANL are two key AN evaluation factors that jointly facilitate the fulfillment of the AN vision. 4. Operations practices  improving autonomous capabilities for networks and operations systems is also key. From the network including NE perspective, the focus is on improving converged sensing, selfconfiguration and native intelligence. From the operations system perspective, the focus is on improving requirement translation, endtoend resource orchestration and crossdomain OM optimization. In order to accelerate largescale AN deployment, the industry has summarized a fivestep operations practice method for reference a. AN implementation planning b. ANL evaluationweakness identification c. strategy and direction selection d. application innovationpilot project verification and e. capability developmentapplication promotion. Organizational capabilities and industry evaluation Organizational capabilities are also a crucial factor for AN implementation. The network operations department, including the corporate culture system, organizational structure, work processes and skills, need to be adjusted or optimized to adapt to the construction of ANs. Then industry evaluation and certification can verify the result of AN implementation. Industry organizations or authorities need to provide an evaluation environment and launch ANL evaluation and certification based on unified standards. Authoritative evaluation and certification increase credibility, help CSPs better serve industry customers and promote winwin industry development. Unified evaluation standards can help carriers improve network and service capabilities and provide customers with a ZeroX service experience. A wellfounded evaluation environment facilitates innovation and verification of technologies and applications, crossvendor collaboration, and endtoend streamlining of business processes. The following sections provide several best practices to help readers better understand the four elements key to AN implementation, evaluation and certification. 3.2. Practices of AN Level ANL Evaluation 3.2.1. China Mobiles ANL Practice First company to target L4 at scale for production by 2025 As the first CSP in the industry to propose the goal of reaching L4 by 2025 and deploying largescale practice, China Mobile has proposed the target architecture and specific vision of zerowaiting, zerofailure and zerocontact, together with self configuration, selfhealing and selfoptimization. The companys target architecture is shown on the next page. IG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0  TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 16 of 105 Figure 2 China Mobiles target architecture First systematic level evaluation methodology and practice Technical assessment covering the full lifecycle  China Mobile has built and practiced the first systematic evaluation system in the industry, including six workflow domains network planning, deployment, maintenance, optimization, operation and inventory management. Thirtyseven types of core capabilities are continuously sorted out and improved around customer response and network quality. Based on the 3D model of operation workflownetwork domainservice domain, 298 subtasks are further sorted out in five major network domains and three categories with 12 key services provided. The scope of subtasks is defined in detail and enriched into 1,328 task contextscenarios to lead 31 provincial companies to apply digital intelligent capabilities closely around the requirements of various domains and services. China Mobile has defined a maturity model as shown in Table 1 to guide the system implementation. It refers to the DIKW data, information, knowledge, wisdom system and aims at the stepbystep construction of system cognitive ability. IG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0  TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 17 of 105 Table 1 China Mobiles AN maturity model Level Based on the model, a clear, unambiguous, operable, and detailed definition of level requirements for all levels should be given to all the task context initially identified. After technical assessment of each scenario, the average score of all scenarios included in each task is calculated as the level of this task. The level of the evaluated network is the average score of all the tasks defined by it. Continuous improvement  combined with the effectiveness indicators, weakness of the system is determined according to the technical assessment result. As each task clearly corresponds to a management responsibility subjectdepartment, the department is responsible for the continuous improvement and subsequent enhancement of this task. Through continuous construction and improvement of autonomy of network elements, the operations and maintenance center OMC and network management systems, the digital intelligent transformation and upgrading of those tasks is realized in a closedloop manner. 3.2.2. China Telecoms Practice AN Characteristics Across ANL China Telecom accelerates the construction of cloudnetwork operation autonomy focuses on closedloop operations faces customers, partners, products, and network  cloud matches the development stage of cloudnetwork integration and defines the intergenerational characteristics of cloudnetwork operation selfintelligence. The company is defining these characteristics across ANL as shown in Figure 3. IG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0  TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 18 of 105 Figure 3 AN characteristics across ANL 3.2.3. China Unicoms Practice ANL Evaluation In the process of practicing AN, China Unicom met some challenges such as how to practice ANL improvement, enhance crosslayers and crossdomain collaboration, and develop a clear evolution path. To solve these challenges, the company has created a systematic toplevel design which took AN level evaluation, capability building and value verification as key actions.  ANL evaluation  to measure the current status of AN capabilities, China Unicom defined an ANL that consisted of two parts  Generic ANL as a framework, the generic ANL was used to unify the characteristics of each level and evolution direction of the AN. China Unicom broke it down into five operation flows and 43 operation tasks and defined generic levels for every operation task.  Domainspecific ANL the function of domainspecific ANL was to make the level feasible and implementable and to guide the AN capability development for network and service domains. China Unicom developed domain specific ANL by focusing on key network and service domains and combining the special characteristics of different domains. Currently, domainspecific for wireless and transmission network, 2H and 2B services have been developed. Table 2 shows the L4 ANL criteria of task Network optimization  Performance deterioration prediction as an example. Table 2 L4 ANL example IG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0  TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 19 of 105  Capability development  to promote specific domain AN capability planning and development, China Unicom formed the capability map for each domain. AN capabilities were split into network layer, platform layer and application layer based on domain ANL criteria.  Value verification  to evaluate and verify the effects of AN evolution, China Unicom set up the AN effectiveness indicator based on the goal of customer oriented agile service and network intelligent operation. China Unicom is conducting networkwide AN practice based on domainspecific AN level criterion, generating the AN capability map, and evaluating the effect and value of the AN implementation for the achievement of the AN objectives. 3.2.4. MTNs Practice Define the DomainSpecific ANL and Evaluate per Subscenario MTN Group aims to have accurate evaluation of ANL for each network per technology domain and guide its operating companies to be innovative from a technologyspecific perspective. Based on the generic ANL criteria defined in 2021, MTN defined domain specific ANL criteria for 43 operation tasks per technology domain. In 2022, MTN established two work streams defining domainspecific criteria and evaluating per sub scenario in the technical domain. 1. Define the domain specific ANL criterial Table 3 Transmission network operation task example IG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0  TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 20 of 105 1. Evaluate per subscenario in technical domain. Live network scenarios for each task in the specified technology domain are listed clearly, and domainspecified ANL criteria are used to evaluate per subscenario. Table 4 Subscenario list example 3.3. Practices of AN Effectiveness Indicators 3.3.1. China Mobiles Practice for Effectiveness Indicators Based on the TM Forum Metrics Framework GB935, and the positioning and value of effectiveness indicators, China Mobile recommends a topdown method for developing effectiveness indicators. This method includes three steps  Step 1 Develop an effectiveness indicator framework based on user value and OM value. There are generic and detailed indicators. Generic indicators measure the general automation and intelligence level of the entire network. Detailed indicators are domain and servicespecific indicators. The principles for selecting the indicators are highly relevant to AN and have the following objectives  User value indicators are designed to fulfill the ZeroX vision and improve the experience of users including industry customers, individual consumers, and partners. For example, zerowait average service provisioning duration, zero touch user selfservice rate and zero trouble service availability.  OM value indicators are designed to fulfill the SelfX vision and reduce network OM costs and improve OM efficiency such as selfconfiguration automatic configuration rate, selfhealing proportion of preventive and predictive OM tickets and selfoptimizing energy efficiency improvement rate.  Step 2 List effectiveness indicators based on the service development and network maintenance objectives. China Mobile selects the core capability automation rate as a generic indicator, which measures the proportion of L2 core capabilities. In addition, 24 detailed indicators and an indicator model are defined. Table 5 provides an example IG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0  TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 21 of 105 Table 5 China Mobiles effectiveness indicator example  Step 3 Define phasespecific targets and different types of views to apply the effectiveness indicators and launch related practices. Based on the effectiveness indicator list, develop and deploy corresponding IT systems. Define effectiveness indicator baselines based on the status quo. Set phase specific targets which can be continuously optimized. Table 6 provides an example. Table 6 China Mobiles effectiveness indicator target example The evaluation results of effectiveness indicators can be used in multiple scenarios. For example, the management view can be used to visualize the status and trend of the indicators. The production view can be used to identify capability weaknesses in order to better develop and improve AN capabilities. 3.3.2. China Telecoms Practice for Effectiveness Indicators To measure the business value of cloud network operations autonomy, China Telecom defines the effectiveness evaluation standard framework, which includes ultrapremium customer experience, ultrafast telecom services and ultraintelligent cloud network operations. This framework, shown in Figure 4, can evaluate the contribution of improving the autonomous level to product services, customer experience and operations efficiency.

Page 22 of 105 Figure 4 China Telecoms evaluation framework China Telecom maps the operations phase and products used in this phase with the effectiveness evaluation standard framework and breaks down the endtoend indicators for cloudnetwork convergence products into system and professional network indicators. The name, formulas and data sources of each indicator are defined. The indicator baselines and the yearbyyear improvement goals absolute values for the next three years are also defined based on live network data analysis. These indicators will drive the development of autonomous capabilities and level evolution. Table 5 on the next page describes some of the indicators and targets.

China Mobile Eastern Data and Western Computing Force Eastern China has a developed economy and therefore demands a large amount of computing power, but it faces tight restrictions around energy consumption and high electricity costs. On the contrary, western China is rich in clean energy and has a wealth of data centers DCs. Western China adopts costeffective, singlebit technology to store and process data, but computing demands in this region are quite low. This is causing companies to look at how to better promote the complementary advantages of the developed economy in the east and the abundant renewable energy in the west to solve the challenge of maximizing the efficiency of clean energy in the country. Solution China Mobile gives full play to the resource advantages of the whole network, comprehensively promoting the capability improvement of the Autonomous Network. Through construction of its Jiutian AI platform, the company is building a nationwide, nonrealtime computing power support base to achieve eastern data trained in western China. Figure 6 shows how it works. Figure 6 China Mobiles Jiutian AI platform supports energy optimization The platform consists of two layers centralized node and distributed edge node. The centralized node provides centralized AI training ability and shared platform resource. When data is generated in fulfilling business demand in the east, the system transmits the data to the western hub and completes the unified training in the Internet data center IDC located in the west using the abundant clean energy. After the training is completed, the AI model is sent back to the east, and the local edge nodes close to the user in the east complete realtime inference and decisionmaking to effectively improve the energy efficiency of overall IT resources. IG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0  TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 25 of 105 Application and benefits The AI ability of eastern data trained in the west has already been applied in many scenarios, including wireless base station energy saving, IDC energy saving, intelligent inspection, crosslayer fault location in the 5G core, network traffic prediction, etc. China Mobile continues to build AI centralized training and inference capability and provides SelfX operation capabilities such as AI centralized selftraining, self analysis to provide customers with ZeroX experience. Collaborating with China Unitech and Huawei, this solution has been piloted in China Mobile Zhejiang and Shaanxi. In terms of AI training and inference, by building a centralized AI platform the utilization rate of IT resources is greatly improved. The AI training server, storage space and power resources are saved. The carbon emissions are reduced by 30, and the overall efficiency is optimized. 4.1.2. China Telecom  MTN  CloudNetwork Convergence Since 2020, global enterprises have accelerated their business migration to the cloud, and gradually moved their key information systems and core production systems to the cloud. Cloudnetwork convergence is a network architecture reform and network capability upgrade which is driven by business requirements and technological innovation. It is a concept that CSPs put forward which aims to take advantage of their infrastructure such as wide area network, largescale DC, and territorial services and provide end customers with cloudnetwork convergent business and services. Business scenarios Customer expectation Cause analysis of the gap Smart operation of cloudnetwork convergence Service provisioning  Access to the cloud anytime, anywhere. One network into the multicloud  Onestop ondemand ordering and change of cloudnetwork business, instant activation  Cloud and Network service is provisioned separately for one customer order  Cross provincial service is provisioned segment by segment.

All Rights Reserved. Page 27 of 105 Figure 7 Intelligent Cloudnetwork convergence business solution China Telecom Smart operation of cloudnetwork convergence Cloudnetwork convergence has become a top priority for many governments and enterprises when they migrate to the cloud. However, in production scenarios such as service provisioning, quality management, and fault management, there are still problems such as inconvenient ordering, long provisioning cycles, inconsistent cloud and network experience, difficult endtoend SLA guarantees, and slow service repairfault handling, which is still far from the expectations of customers. The cloudnetwork convergence smart operation solution adopts the architecture and concept of network moving with the cloud and cloudnetwork integration, It introduces SRv6, flow detection, AI and cloudnetwork intelligence and other ICT technologies and cloudnetwork operating systems to comprehensively improve multiple automation and intelligence capabilities such as realtime selfawareness of cloudnetwork resource topology and status, unified and selforganized resources, selfgenerated SLA policies, selfconfigured service activation, selforganizing, selfguarantee, self healing and selfoptimization of service quality and cloudnetwork failure. The business scenarios below show which autonomous network capabilities are used  Service provisioning The business operation layer provides industry templates for government and enterprise customers. It can take customers orders and change cloudnetwork services in onestop and ondemand. It integrates customer requirements for SLA and cost, automatically generates SLA strategies and drives service and resource operation layers for configuration. The service operation layer is based on the cloudnetwork unified operation support system, integrates the capabilities of each segment of business activation, and selforganizing cloud and network resources in a unified manner to achieve customeroriented oneclick activation. Finally, the resource operation layer deploys cloudnetwork points of presence PoPs to support users to enter the cloud quickly and from any location. The resource layer IG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0  TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 28 of 105 opens the underlying capabilities to realize the automatic configuration of VPNs, tunnels, slices, etc., to support the rapid opening of services.  Quality Management Service quality and customer experience drive the single domain autonomy and crosslayer link in the closedloop of the service and resource operation layer. The business operation layer provides cloud and network business visualized selfmanagement clients for government and enterprise customers. These enable internal operation and maintenance, and they build a comprehensive view of cloud and network information, supporting intelligent marketing, agile activation, and crossdomain collaborative operation and maintenance. The service operation layer collects the resource status and service quality information of each segment of the network autonomous domain in real time, visually presents the service SLA situation, realizes end toend SLA analysis and prediction and selfguarantee. It also automatically generates selfhealing or selfoptimization strategies. According to the service requirements, the operation layer can sense, analyze, and report the quality of each segment of the network in real time based on technologies such as telemetry and flow detection, and realize selfhealing or selfoptimization of the network based on SRv6 technology.  Fault Management The Service operation layer provides mapping relationships between the business and the network, aggregates the cloud and network service information of each segment and triggers the service fault recovery intent. The Resource layer translates the intent through the cloud and network resource orchestration and scheduling with zero interruption. Each autonomous domain of the resource operation layer automatically reports alarmsfaults and completes selfhealing actions such as resetting and restarting for rapid fault recovery. For highlevel autonomy capabilities, the intent resolution module is developed to build general intent resolutions and reverse translation capabilities to provide capability support for the three operation layers to achieve 4 intent based closed loops. The cloudnetwork integrated agile opening and smart operation solution adopts a unified planning, singledomain autonomy first and then crossdomain collaboration for pilot verification and production network deployment. At present, largescale deployments of the three scenarios of service provisioning, 5G service quality management, and fault management has been achieved, with the following results  No waiting, hourlevel service provisioning 5G slice configuration and number signing are automatically activated throughout the entire process, which has been implemented in more than 30 customer projects in the four provinces of Beijing, Guangdong, Jiangsu and Zhejiang. The entire process of product deployment and launch, from order acceptance to opening is automated. Product loading has been upgraded from monthlyweekly to hourly level, saving more than 20 mandays per project on average. The autonomous network level has been upgraded from L2.1 to L3.0.  Differentiated, endtoend SLA guarantee Through 5G fullservice intelligent perception and diagnosis capabilities, it can realize linkage alarm dispatch and endtoend selfclosed loop. At present, the firstlevel system has been deployed in China Telecoms 31 provincial subnets, and it has begun to run, analyze and process data from 31 provinces, and carry out SLA monitoring and assurance. The autonomous network level has been upgraded from L1.9 to L2.7.  Zerofailure, minutelevel business recovery AI automatic identification of cloudnetwork hidden dangers have been deployed in China Telecoms 29 IG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0  TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 29 of 105 provincial subnets, realizing hidden risks minutelevel discovery, business minutelevel recovery and fault hourlevel processing. The failure automatic processing rate reached 40, the major incident business automatic recovery rate was 60, and the processing efficiency increased by 85. The autonomous network level has been upgraded from L1 to L2. MTN Cloud Private Line Convergence Cloud Private Line convergence needs to be established to support online selfservice for subscribers, supporting network slicing, guaranteeing differentiated SLA, and supporting zeroX operational experience. However, gaps still exist due to complex protocols, complex cloud network configurations, lack of service visibilities, and operational difficulties in fault detection and analysis. To successfully implement cloud private line convergence, automation and autonomy are required to guarantee network readiness and augment operation services. The 3layers with 4closed loops framework of figure 19 above is applied in the lifecycle of cloudprivate line convergent process as detailed below  Resource layer closedloop hierarchical slice based private network is constructed with SRv6EVPN, programmable and selfoptimizing paths, and telemetrybased SLA real time awareness and visualization per service. Network service API interface is enabled to the upper OSS layer for a fast service request.  Service layer closedloop Operation service efficiency is improved with zeroX service experience, with selfX capabilities. For example, service fault recovery can be performed with zerointerruptions through complex, cross domain fault demarcation and analysis, which drive selfoptimizing and selfhealing at the resource layer. The status of the recovery will be reported back to the service layer for smart operation and maintenance.  Business layer closedloop This layer is enabled with oneclick fast scheduling, onehop to the cloud, and onenetwork wide connection business service capabilities. Business intent is driven at the upper business layer and interacts with the lower service and resource layer with open APIs. This drives efficient scheduling of cloudnetwork resources with AI algorithms, establishes cloud access paths across domains and minutelevel multicloud access to construct a hierarchical slice based private network providing guaranteed differentiated services for high value customers. China Mobile Automatic Provisioning of Cloud Network Services towards Enterprise customers Traditional cloudnetworking service provisioning is performed manually, and it involves multiple different steps, including service analysis, resource survey, command compiling, verification and testing. Endtoend service provisioning usually takes several days. China Mobile has developed an IP Maintenance Platform, where AN capabilities are implemented to significantly improve service provisioning efficiency in combination with containerized and microservice architecture. Using the 3layer AN framework, the detailed technical path is as follows  Realtime network awareness The resource operation layer provides realtime collection of network status and performance in each autonomous domain with several protocols, such as simple network management protocol SNMP, IG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0  TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 30 of 105 commandline interface CLI, NetFlow, telemetry, and twoway active management protocol TWAMP. The service operation layer makes a high level endtoend analysis of autonomous domains.  Zerotouch service provisioning Based on the overall realtime status of network, the service operation layer dynamically calculates the optimal path and executes automatic configuration. AIpowered network path calculation is adopted to get the result within only a few seconds. The resource operation layer provides dynamic and accurate resource allocation for service provisioning.  Selfmanaging enables highefficient agile deployment The resource operation layer provides atomic abilities with Netconf a highefficient  complete transaction protocol. Common capabilities can be quickly developed on demand and be shared and reused in multiple cases. The service operation layer assembles these capabilities to achieve a serviceoriented ability for the business operation layer to invoke. The IP Maintenance Platform enables AN features such as zerotouch, and zerowait to the endtoend process from service subscription to service provisioning, reducing the total time of fulfilling cloudnetworking services to only a few minutes. This improves customer satisfaction and increases the autonomous network level of China Mobile from L1 to L3. 4.1.3. Flexible Computing Network Scheduling Global enterprises are accelerating the process of cloud access. Carriers are looking to leverage their advantageous networks and computing power to streamline computing power in the society, centrally and flexibly schedule computing power from different sources, and provide enterprises with more convenient, secure, and reliable cloud access experience. However, the scale and direction of enterprises digital traffic are uncertain. Around 30 of traffic needs to be scheduled across different provinces on the entire network, creating daunting challenges to carrier network coverage, timeliness of ondemand provisioning, and flexibility of networkwide scheduling. Collaborative cloudnetwork development needs to be accelerated to promote cloud network integrated OM.  Rapid coverage of transport capacity Carriers quickly deploy quality networks for enterprises in order to support digital transformation of enterprise services.  Quick acquisition of transport capacity Optimal network paths are recommended based on enterprise intents, such as latency SLA, computing resources, and traffic calendar.  Transportcomputing power collaboration Cloud access circuits and inter cloud interconnection circuits can be deployed or removed on demand within a few seconds, adapting to traffic changes and elastic bandwidth, and allowing enterprise applications to flexibly obtain computing power. The flexible computing network scheduling solution focuses on deploying basic transport capacity for carriers alloptical networks. The capabilities to selfsense and selfconfigure transport capacity are implemented to quickly develop resources for wide coverage computing networks and access premium cloud connections in one hop.

Page 31 of 105 Network selfsensing Realtime secondslevel or millisecondslevel sensing is implemented across the entire network, between clouds, and on cloud access connections. The network latency, bandwidth, and usage, as well as the usage of top N cloud pool resources and other information can be perceived and visualized on the GIS map.  Intercloud transport capacity matrix From the computing power perspective, clearly displays network information including latency, bandwidth, and usage of interconnected computing resource pools after selfowned and social computing power are applied to the network.  Latency circle for cloud access transport capacity From the enterprise perspective, renders the latency circle 1 ms  5 ms  20 ms for quality transport capacity in order to identify the distribution of computing power available to enterprises. Network selfconfiguring The transport capacity of each cloud pool on the entire network is displayed from enterprise perspective to facilitate the deployment of high quality networks with low latency and elastic bandwidth. Quality cloud access paths are intelligently recommended based on the SLA latency, bandwidth, and availability of enterprise cloud access. Cloud access paths for millions of NEs can be scheduled and deployed within just a few seconds, implementing ondemand elastic scaling of network connections deployment and removal. China Unicom Guangdong and Huawei are the first to jointly deploy this innovative solution to select paths based on service requirements and perform elastic scaling of cloud access connections during peak hours, improving SLA assurance. This solution helps China Unicom quickly achieve 100 coverage of highquality transport capacity and deploy a service ecosystem.

Enabling Verticals Autonomous Networks Hyperloops Enabling SmartX Industries  Smart TourismStadium With the Covid19 pandemic impacting business and daily life in so many ways, just imagine the new disruptive services that will emerge. They will be completely autonomous, designed for zerotouch and zerofault operations and autoscaling based on experience expectations. This use case from a recent TM Forum Catalyst championed by five CSPs from around the world looks at how AN can help this new normal for the onsite and onpremises hybrid environment. Telecoms and industry verticals focus on both operational efficiency and business growth, providing agile business and support models to maintain or enforce resiliency in unforeseen crises and get new revenue even during tough periods. To address this new normal, service providers need to realize autonomous ICT services with autonomous digital enabling services, while simultaneously solving the challenges of crossdomaincrossvertical and hybrid networks for innovative new services. In phase three, the smart tourismstadium Catalyst is scoped as a key entry point for AN services in a digital marketplace. This includes both global experiences as a citizen onsite and remote viewing of matches onpremises as a part of the citizen journey through ondemand AN including zerotouch operations, closed loops and business intent. In the demonstration, a tourist visiting a place either real or virtual needs a seamless experience based on their preferences. The needs could be mostly dynamic and at that moment have to be served without any complexity, which might cause an unpredictable surge in demand on infrastructure, and this surge might require manual operation. Deploying massive, dedicated networks dynamically and flexibly, while ensuring sustainability and efficiency becomes a big challenge. Figure 9 Examples of vertical use cases that benefit from ANs Smart tourism and stadium services are trending use cases where ANs are key for CSPs to deploy smart solutions and services that can enrich a fans experience and safety and increase the CSPs profitability by providing valueadded services dynamically. These solutions will require the connection of many IoT and mobile devices that are densely populated within a stipulated area gathering lots of information such as location, footfall, trending demand, etc. IG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0  TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 33 of 105 One of the key questions CSPs are exploring is how they can improve fans experience with autonomous drones and cameras to enrich game experiences and extend livelike experiences even in cases when fans are not allowed to be in the stadium. The drones and cameras will be connected to a wireless access network, and they will keep capturing the game at various views and positions, streaming live video feeds to the fans via an app on their smartphone or VR headsets. Connectivity solutions like private 5G can deliver massive bandwidth and meet demands for very low latency. Machine learning and AI will use the information from image and video analytics to provide the best fan experience  tracking their favorite player, for example. AI can also enhance safety  by quickly detecting fights or brawls that may break out, for example  and recommending immediate actions. The Catalyst is described in more detail on the next pages, considering 1 architecture 2 enabling smart stadiums and selfservice fulfillment 3 intentbased operations and 4 scalability and efficiency. 1. Solution architecture powering ANs To achieve ANs for vertical use cases, maturity is required across several loops including resource, service, business and user. The simplified architecture to achieve this maturity is shown in Figure 10, followed by an explanation of each level of operations. Figure 10 Simplified solution architecture of Ans  Business operations BO  this layer presents business rules and business intent for selfplanning and selfmarketing e.g., selfordering, including autonomous orderto activation to facilitate zerofriction products for users.  Service operations SO  this layer represents autonomous service lifecycle management comprising selfordering, selforganizing, selfmanaging and self assuring. It captures business intent and governs the accurate translation of service intents to resource intents.

All Rights Reserved. Page 34 of 105 physical, virtual, and logical resources in order to fulfill the resource intents and address the customers requirements. CSPs can monetize and support SmartX industries like smart cities smart stadium, tourism, farming, energy, smart manufacturing and smart healthcare by leveraging the above verticaldomainagnostic technical architecture. Governance and business limits of autonomous operations While ANs and the autonomous operations processes designed to support them make great use of AI and machine learning, the activities of those new capabilities must be put under governance processes and roles, monitored and observe defined business limits. While governance and monitoring can be executed in advance and in hindsight, defining business limits is an activity that needs to be executed in near real time. Repair and scale activity provided in autonomous operations is a huge benefit, but measures must be in place to avoid activity that is against the CSPs or customers business interests. This is playing out differently in B2B and in B2C scenarios. For the observance and execution of these business limits as budget caps or spending limits, new capabilities are needed in business support system BSS components. A business process within the businessserviceresource closed loop needs to execute the checks, and a proposed budget limit or business limit API needs to be available to check against the defined boundaries on the CSP and customer side. 1. Enabling smart stadiumtourism CSPs can monetize the smart stadiumtourism use case to empower stadiums and sports clubs and to enrich fans experience with experience and safety. They can also enable constant timeefficient management of stadiums by leveraging ZeroX experiences based on the AN business and technical architecture across the layers including edge cameras and drones, video capability, edge containers, virtualization, automated to autonomous operations, AI and insights analytics, and 5G. The reference architecture to achieve AN for smart stadiums or tourism is depicted in Figure 11. Figure 11 Smart stadium use case For example, a tourist visiting Paris for the Olympic Games would like to have augmented maps to guide them through public transportation and to get dynamic fan experiences at the venue or stadium. This is an example of autonomous touristfan experience and safety. IG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0  TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 35 of 105 The smart stadium scenarios described above aim to demonstrate autonomous behavior across all loops explained further in the next section with the 5G network as the connectivity backbone and video analytics capabilities at the edge. Autonomous selfservice fulfillment is depicted in Figure 9 as an example of usage of AN capabilities. More details can be found in this Catalyst white paper. Autonomous selfservice fulfillment One of the key elements of providing seamless autonomous services to fans is zero friction service fulfillment. Its a leapfrog transformation in terms of quality of service from manual and timeconsuming workflows to autonomous selfordering and self managed networks. Autonomous selfservice fulfillment workflow aims at seamless experience in services extended to fans and optimizing total cost of ownership for the service provider in managing the stadiums. Key elements of the autonomous workflow depicted in the figure aim to deliver zero friction services to fans  User intent management  Service and resource usage requirements QoSQoESLA  Zerotouch service provisioning and onboarding  Autonomous service delivery  Dynamic resource scale inout and optimization Closedloop remediation with intent  Budget limitbased service delivery Figure 12 Selfordering 1. Intent translation and decomposition study Service providers and end customers users have varied demands for services over a network. While meeting end users demands, service providers want to minimize the amount of data that is transmitted to reduce operating costs and respond quickly to maintain user satisfaction. These demands are defined as intents see Section 3, and the aim is to enable service operation on the basis of them. Well look at some additional intent use cases in Section 5.2. IG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0  TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 36 of 105 Figure 13 shows the technologies for achieving intentbased operation. Intents are not always given as specific requirements by users. For example, ambiguous demands for functional requirements, such as enjoying watching sports, or ambiguous demands with no index or value for the quality or performance of certain functions, such as feeling of being there can be assumed. Figure 13 Fundamental technologies of intentbased operation To apply these ambiguous intents in service operation, the team needs to break them down and define a set of requirements intent definition  see Figure 14. To express quantitative values of nonfunctional requirements related to quality or performance, the Catalyst is studying the definition of general indices for various intents and quantitative values for each index. Figure 14 Intent definition IG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0  TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 37 of 105 Intentextraction technology This technology collects information related to users intents and extracts a set of specific requirements. Intentrelated information is 1 language information through the input interface for users and 2 information obtained inservice related to these users. The Catalyst aims to extract a set of specific requirements that users have by using various types of information. Resourcerequirementconversion technology Specific requirements extracted with intentextraction technology need to be converted into indicators that can be controlled by the resource controller. A twostep function, 1 quantitative intent  highlowlevel intent 2 highlowlevel intent  configuration, is required. The technology to achieve quantitative intent can be developed not only by conventional machine learning, but also by the hierarchical KPI structure and implications of KPIs for intents. Implementation architecture of AN hyperloops By combining SelfX capabilities with intent study, the Catalyst is exploring much new ground, and new component areas need to be introduced in reference to AN reference architecture. Intent extraction as part of knowledge and intelligence plays a major role in during the journey to usable intentdriven orchestration see Figure 15. Figure 15 Implementation architecture 1. Scalability and elasticity with energy efficiency The Covid19 crisis is accelerating digital transformation across industries. Digitalization dramatically changes customer behavior. Driven by the new demand for contactless selfservice ordering, many companies have seen ondemand services as a critical priority for the upcoming years, and continuously automate processes to improve efficiency, respond to fastchanging customers needs and so on. IG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0  TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 38 of 105 Using AI to make energy use more efficient The change in energy consumption over time brings time series data that can be used to understand patterns and predict future patterns. Machine learning can be used to achieve the best energy efficiency and AI can be used for solving the time series forecasting problem. In the implementation, various data such as configuration, network traffic and performance indicators can be collected from the live network. Deep learning can further predict future network traffic and energy utilization. Based on AI prediction, some interfaces and functions of the device can be turned off without affecting the service experience to achieve the purpose of energy saving. Ondemand selfservice networks make eco easy Networkondemand not only provides business agility, but also costeffective energy efficiency. ANs keep network services performing smoothly and fulfill the SLA target. Moreover, the Catalyst introduces the capability to dynamically onboard network functions depending on the specific connectivity requirements whenever needed and to promptly eliminate those functions once the requirements are fulfilled, so as not to consume more energy. 4.1.5. Autonomous Networks Hyper Loops for disruptive digital services Phase II  Smart Agriculture New, disruptive and innovative digital services that are completely autonomous and designed for zerotouch and zerofault operations could revolutionize the future of how we do business and interact with society. These new digital services offer a great opportunity for service providers to increase their revenue through new services they can offer to their customers. To be able to offer many of these digital services such as smart industry, cities or health, CSPs need to automate their operations and gain efficiencies so that they can be delivered at a cost point the market requires. Autonomous Networks with zerowait, zerotouch and zerotrouble capabilities empower CSPs to monetize  support the diverse set of vertical use case requirements. Once Autonomous Networks are in place service providers, B2C customers, digital service providers DSPs and telecom service providers will benefit from better, seamless experiences and improved operational efficiencies. In addition, the endtoend lifecycle complexity will be hidden away from the user and self assurance will be inbuilt. IG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0  TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 39 of 105 Figure 16 Examples of vertical use cases that benefit from Autonomous Networks From the vertical examples listed above, smart agriculture is a paradigmatic use case where Autonomous Networks are key for CSPs to deploy smart agriculture solutions and services that can help farmers become more efficient and increase their profitability by managing crops and livestock in realtime. These solutions will require the connection of many IoT devices spread over large and complex areas gathering lots of information such as tractor location, weather forecasts, soil moisture levels etc. A good example of smart agriculture being currently explored by one CSP is how they can improve rice planting with autonomous drones, to optimize seed use, avoid planting during unfavorable weather as well as improve worker efficiency. The drones will be connected to a wireless access network and collect lots of data from sensors and sources such as weather reports and then collate all of this data as well as stream back live video feeds to the farmers via an app on their smartphone. Machine learning and AI will use all of this information to recommend the best time to plant the seeds as well as to pick out the most favorable locations to increase yield and reduce the risk of disease by spotting the disease signs early and recommending immediate actions. Solution Architecture powering Autonomous Networks To achieve Autonomous Networks for vertical use cases as described above, maturity is required across the Resource Loop, Service Loop, Business Loop and User Loop. The simplified architecture to achieve this maturity is as shown below IG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0  TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved.

China Telecom Smart Manufacturing  MultiCloud and MultiBase Autonomous and Flexible Interconnection Large manufacturers typically own multiple RD bases, manufacturing campuses, test sites and offices. To leverage digital transformation in many areas of the business including RD, manufacturing, office buildings and marketing departments, manufacturers require a network to suit the needs of manufacturing, research, quality inspection and marketing. Such a network featuring multibranch collaboration and onepoint access to multiple clouds is described in Figure 22. Figure 22 Manufacturers network needs IG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0  TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 45 of 105 To meet the requirements of manufacturers, China Telecom integrates the cloud network and operations system combining with the threelayer AN architecture. This allows the company to introduce new technologies and ideas, build the cloud private network solution, and implement AN cloud network operations. On one hand, the business and service operations layers deliver cloud network management and control capabilities to enterprises. Customized and lightweight operations applications and selfservice options, such as service selfsubscription, traffic control selfadjustment, network selfmonitoring and fault selfmaintenance are available for enterprise network management personnel. On the other hand, automatic and intelligent service orchestration and cloud network resource orchestration and scheduling are applied to build servicelevel slices in private networks for various production scenarios in the manufacturing industry. For example, dedicated slice and deterministic capability assurance are provided for production services. IP MANs are used to provide office and outbound services. Intelligent slices are used to flexibly plan bandwidth and priorities on demand for broadband scheduling services such as design solution, video conference and finance. With a complete network topology, the traffic direction and link status on the private network are monitored in real time. At the resource operations layer, exclusive access devices are deployed in enterprise campuses. These devices are preconnected to multiple clouds and networks to implement integrationfree and onestop access. Technologies such as slicing, SRv6, and inband detection are introduced, improving the precision and accuracy of automatic network performance detection and the flexibility of intelligent service path optimization, and providing differentiated and deterministic SLA assurance for different applications. Figure 23 Overall architecture of the cloud private network solution China Telecoms cloud private network solution has been widely applied to thousands of large manufacturers, helping them achieve multilocation autonomous interconnection, intelligent traffic control, independent and visualized management control, and improved SLAs. The solution deploys private line services into overall connected services, consolidates the capability of one network connection to multiple clouds, and provides a better multicloud access experience for enterprises. Some of the positive results include IG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0  TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 46 of 105  Multilocation autonomous interconnection  shortens the private line provisioning time on both the cloud and network from one to two weeks to a few minutes. Ondemand and flexible networking is supported, meeting enterprises requirements for cloud access through any network, one line to multiple clouds, and highquality mutual access between multiple bases.  Intelligent traffic control  reduces IT personnels workload by 20.  Independent and visualized management control  provisions new connections within minutes and changes SLA levels such as bandwidth and latency.  Improved SLAs  reduces the maximum oneway latency from 15ms to 3ms, the maximum jitter from 60ms to 150ms, and brings down the average packet loss rate from 1 to 0.001, providing highquality network services for enterprises. 4.1.7. China Unicom Agile Service Provisioning  IntentBased Automatic Provisioning of Enterprise Private Lines Legacy enterprise private line service provisioning was mainly performed manually, including networking solution design, resource scheduling and resource allocation, and the workflow of service provisioning had breakpoints for automation. When resources were available, the service provisioning still required one week. China Unicom is committed to providing customers with zerowait and selfprovisioning agile service experience and proposes an intentbased automatic provisioning solution for private line services. The solution adopts the threelayer architecture of AN and uses intentionconversion technology to convert the customers business intention into the specific service, sending the request to the orchestration module through the intent execution interface. Figure 24 on the next page shows how autonomous service provisioning works, and an explanation of what happens at each layer follows. Figure 24 Autonomous service provisioning IG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0  TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 47 of 105 Business operationintent handler  converts a customers business intention into a service intention. The handler receives the customers intention, determines the specific service through intent matching, and invokes the service through the intent execution interface. Take internet private line provisioning as an example. It is a business intention, and through intention matching decides to provision an internet private line service, such as PON. Service operationservice orchestration  this refers to the Open Digital Architecture ODA Product, Service, Resource PSR model. The network service is orchestrated into resource and customerfacing services RFS and CFS through a graphical user interface based on the service provisioning action flow. The designed and compiled CFS model is deployed to the running state and uses an Open API to provide services. For example, the Internet private line can be orchestrated as PON access CFS, IP RAN access CFS, and fiber direct connection CFS. Resource operation  the provisioning platform is connected to the fixed access domain network management system NMS, transport domain NMS, line management system, and public customer system, thus realizing endtoend automatic provisioning of private lines. The intentbased enterprise private line automatic provisioning solution hides the complexity of the operations and reduces seven manual processes. The provisioning duration is shortened from days to minutes. This effectively improves customer experience and improves the autonomous network level from L1 to L3 in service provisioning scenarios. 4.2. Customer Experience and Business Growth 4.2.1.

China MobileIntelligent Diagnosis of Network Quality for Home Broadband Services After the epidemic in 2020, rigid demands for home offices and online education have been activated. The rapid popularity of new applications such as video live broadcast, XR games, and smart home has further promoted the development and popularization of home broadband services, especially gigabit broadband. The diversity of requirements and services raises higher requirements on broadband rates, latency, availability, and fault rectification. Therefore, how to comprehensively and accurately perceive the service experience of each home broadband user, provide certain service assurance, and obtain greater business value through precision marketing of value added services are the key issues that CSPs need to address in the operation of home broadband services.  Experience assurance Existing problems such as insensitive perception, inaccurate positioning and untimely processing could greatly affect the user experience of home broadband services.  Value improvement Users requirements for value improvement services such as quality improvement different SLA assurance, home networking, and smart home cannot be accurately identified. China Mobile fully absorbs the concept of singledomain autonomy and crossdomain collaboration of autonomous networks and introduces technologies such as Xgboost algorithm, edge computing, telemetry secondlevel collection, big data analysis, and network topology restoration. Focus on improving SelfX capabilities, such as selfmarketing for target customers, selfmonitoringreporting of service quality, selforchestration of network resources, selfhealing of faults, and selfoptimization of performance, to achieve precise value improvement and proactive service experience assurance.  Selfguaranteed service experience, selfhealing and self optimization The service operation layer monitors and reports user experience in real time, proactively identifies users with a poor experience, predicts complaints and prevents mass faults, drives user marketing or retention, and improves service and network quality. The service operation layer automatically analyzes the various code streams of video and games traffic in real time, finely identifies traffic types, and perceives the quality problem of different traffic according to the preset differential threshold.

MTNNFVO Enable Network Autodeployment, Autoadaptation and Intelligent Anomalies Awareness Recently, MTN has been accelerating its telecom cloud strategy MUNIC. In particular, automation is the key component of the MUNIC 2.0 strategy and is under planning and deployment. With the application of cloudnative architecture and the introduction of slicing and MEC scenarios, the cloudbased core network has been becoming increasingly complex. There are one hundred times more maintenance objects and the change operations occur more frequently. In such complex OM scenarios, traditional methods are no longer fit for purpose. NFVO functions as an orchestration system providing network function virtualization services. It is used to orchestrate and schedule NFV network services and resources, implement automatic network deployment and unified OM, and accelerate the automatic transformation based on MTNs MUNIC 2.0 strategy. In addition, NFVO is also an indispensable component facilitating the evolution from level 3 and level 4 of the ADN. By managing, controlling, and analyzing network resources, NFVO can complete closedloop handling of resources and achieve the vision of self configuration. IG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0  TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 57 of 105 Figure 31 Autonomous Core Network Architecture Solution Introduction Automatic network deployment. The architecture of the core network is rather complex. As a result, traditional methods of network configuration can be seriously inefficient. Configuration scripts are sent to switches or routers manually, taking more than two weeks to compile the network configuration and more than one week to configure the network. This has severe impacts on delivery efficiency. NFVO provides the automatic DCN configuration capabilities and automatically generates NSD and VNFD files. Afterwards, NFVO delivers commands to complete network configuration and VNF deployment. By automating the previously manual operations, the network generation time is shortened from several weeks to a couple of days, significantly improving network configuration and deployment efficiency. Network automatic adaptation. Traditionally, the capacity expansion of VNFs is manually performed. Moreover, there is little collaboration between manual network configuration and VNF capacity expansion. As a result, VM networks are disconnected after the capacity expansion. In migration scenarios, related network configurations and security policies cannot be migrated at the same time as VMs. NFVO supports automatic network adjustment, online visualized network editing, and realtime detection of NE changes. During capacity expansion and service migration, network configurations can be automatically streamlined, and security and QoS policies can be migrated. Network anomalies awareness. Thousands of counters exist in the core network. As such, distinguishing the key counters from others is a daunting task. With NFVO, the network performance can be monitored, and the correlated counters and counter reports can be customized so that any issues regarding these counters can be analyzed, regardless of their types. In order to facilitate performance analysis, the KPI IG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0  TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 58 of 105 insight feature of NFVO has two major functions network quality monitoring and root cause analysis expert. KPI insight monitors the counters by classifying them into six categories accessibility, retainability, mobility, capacity, coverage, and service quality. Counter exceptions can be detected within 5 minutes. Additionally, KPI insight provides flexible drilling and correlation functions to locate the root cause of issues related to the aforementioned counters and enables users to customize counter thresholds when the functions are being used. KPI insight is a fast, precise, and powerful feature. Future Outlook In the future, we will continue our efforts in the field of NFVO to build network management, control, and analysis capabilities, raise the automation and intelligence levels of E2E management throughout the corenetwork life cycle, and keep improving network deployment and OM efficiency in multiple scenarios, such as the centralized cloud and MEC. 4.2.7. MTNBusiness Intent Close Loop Like all global CSPs MTN needs to address a number of key challenges including managing the huge traffic growth driven by OTT and video streaming, increase ARPU and shutdown legacy networks such as 3G to refarm the frequencies to deliver CAPEX and OPEX efficiencies. To increase data usage, MTN launched a Double Data initiative and promoting and migrating users from existing 2G and 3G networks to 4G was a key priority. To ensure success, MTN developed a framework that supports automation in most aspects of this initiative to address the following challenges  Difficulty in identifying potential 4G users  dynamic profiling of subscribers that have the highest propensity to accept migration proposals e.g., a user generating more than 30MB using a 2G device  Low migration efficiency and low marketing success rate  additional metrics to support campaign initiatives such as recent user behavior on the network and offer acceptance rate  High fallback of 4G users due to poor 4G network quality To overcome these challenges an endtoend crossfunctional 23G to 4G User Migration usecase was implemented. At the technology layer and to automate identification of potential users, an advanced analytical capability was implemented powered by Huaweis SmartCare solution in some of the MTN operating markets. A joint operation team with MTN was put in place to accelerate the development of the 4G users. It utilized the MAN Market, Area, Network model to maximize the value of the user migration lifecycle based on the 4G user journey. MAN provided a 360 degrees holistic view through AI based modeling by leveraging on data from OSS, BSS and social media. The model provides insights such as subscriber location distribution with key behaviors, network readiness index distribution, marketing readiness index distribution and target areacity. Intent Driven Interactions For this particular use case the business intent is to migrate 2G and 3G users to 4G. Intent is one of the key components that make up the TM Forum Autonomous Network framework. The role of intent in autonomous network is to clearly communicate requirements and goals. For this use case data is collected from various sources such as OSS and BSS to identify the potential 4G users. An intent report is produced to show the marketing IG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0  TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 59 of 105 success of the campaign. The intent report will show the status and success of the intent handling. Architecture and Solution Figure 32 Architecture and Solution The diagram above shows the 4 steps of the user migration solution which are described below  Step 1 Accurate Identification of Potential 4G Users AIML model is used to develop smart insights. Algorithms such as Random Forest, XGBoost, and GDBT Gradient Boosting Decision Tree are used for 4G user identification by leveraging on OSS, BSS, service and user segment analysis data. It analyzes users who do terminal switch, SIM card replacement and 4G terminal replacement and will output user value, service behavior, geographical location and user group classification.  Step 2 Package Tariff Design and Promotion Scheme Data from the previous analysis is used to ensure precise marketing by designing subscriber package tariffs based on subscriber ARPU and migration bonus.  Step 3 Marketing Campaign Execution The lists of potential users are provided to the MTN marketing system from SmartCare and the campaign is executed. To maximize success, we have clear campaign rules, methodology for scheduling and prioritization of subscribers, tailored rewards and SMS execution.  Step 4 Postmigration Evaluation We monitor the migrated users looking at the trend and traffic and service behavior. A weekly report is produced to show the marketing campaign success and the effect of the reward scheme.

CloudNetwork LowLatency AN Solution Cloud access has become a primary need in the course of enterprises digital transformation. However, carriers face the following problems in providing services  Traditional networks provide nondifferentiated connection services, which cannot guarantee the experience of services that have special requirements on latency, such as videos and games.  Dozens of links are deployed between backbone nodes on an IP network. Due to limited resources, traffic is forwarded in load balancing mode, causing unstable latency for highvalue services. To ensure a low latency, the traffic processing mode needs to be manually adjusted, which takes a long time and involves complicated errorprone configurations. To improve the poor tenant experience due to a long latency on cloud private lines, a long service optimization period, and other issues, carrier A and Huawei jointly deployed the first commercial E2E cloudnetwork lowlatency plane for Internet services. The SDNSRv6 policybased IP AN solution and digital and serviceoriented capabilities on the network resource layer are used to enable service and business IG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0  TM Forum 2023.

Figure 35 CloudNetwork LowLatency AN Solution architecture  Business operations Flexible service selforchestration enables tenant selfservice. A realtime digital network map is developed to display the latency of the entire network and form a serviceoriented latency circle. Service subscription preevaluation is supported to ensure that the latency meets service requirements. Tenants can subscribe to service SLA changes. Network capabilities are provided as a series of ecommerce products for tenants.  Service operations Service selfhealing enables deterministic network services. The digital network map features more than 15 builtin path computation factors, which can be used to automatically plan network paths that meet service SLA requirements, providing a low latency and realtime monitoring assurance for VIP services. Faults can be located within just a few minutes, and poorQoE services can be automatically optimized, delivering a lowlatency for VIP users.  Resource operations Network autonomy, intelligent scheduling of networkwide tunnels, and automatic optimization upon congestion. The SRv6 tunnel optimization solution uses technologies such as TWAMP and telemetry to detect the service SLA status in real time. If the latency increases, intelligent tunnel optimization is triggered to optimize network traffic distribution and ensure that the SLA is met for VIP services, improving OM efficiency by more than 30 when compared with the traditional adjustment method.

Page 63 of 105 Traffic has been optimized for approximately 100 links between more than 20 core routers in Fujian province. The service latency from Ningde to Quanzhou is reduced by 53.4, and that from Ningde to Xiamen is reduced by 44.7, significantly improving tenant service experience and accelerating the evolution towards AN. Huawei will continue to work with carriers to further explore innovative network autonomy solutions to tackle major concerns about cloudnetwork services, in order to provide ondemand intelligent scheduling of computing power and networks, lower the OM cost, and conserve energy. 4.2.10. IntentDriven AN IDAN Use Cases Business, service and network operations are becoming increasingly complex as they encompass multiple domains using multiple partners solutions. This means that manual and static processes must give way to model and knowledgedriven approaches that are based on business intent. By adopting a knowledgecentric approach, services can adapt and evolve autonomously as network conditions, business goals and customers requirements shift over time. Customers can have a better experience if their needs are captured and translated into intent without revealing any implementation details. Autonomous systems are governed according to intents, which are standardized by using an open interface. The multiphased Intentdriven Autonomous Networks for Smart Mobility Catalyst developed an initial intent interface and model that works at all three operational layers  intents at the business layer, which will cascade not decompose down to the service and resource layers. Use case 1 Intentdriven Autonomous Networks for smart mobility This use case is a cellular vehicletoeverything CV2X scenario that demonstrates how true intent implementations decouple layers and allow for better optimization of services and resources based on the business objectives defined by the CSP. CSPs want to apply autonomous network technologies and principles to the problem space of toll road operationstransportation. Figure 36 illustrates IDAN phase I IG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0  TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 64 of 105 In this case, the autonomous network uses Intent APIs to automatically convert user requirements at the application layer into network languages, implementing agile service provisioning and simplified operation. At the same time, networks are automatically optimized based on user requirements and network status to implement intelligent OM. Road users communicate their requirements at the application layer. The autonomous network automatically divides user requirements layer by layer Intent API at business layer  service layer  resource layer, translates requirements into system instructions and executes them. The AN feedback the instruction execution result to the user or upperlayer system layer by layer. Each autonomous layer of the overall system architecture leverages an intent approach and this, in turn, changes the focus to each system to be more self contained, autonomous systems that focus on their respective closed loops. Use case 2 Intentdriven Autonomous Networks for dynamic pricing connectivity service This use case demonstrates a dynamic pricing scenario that provides zerotouch customer experience, selfhealing and selfoptimization capabilities leveraging intent. The scenario applies to customers needing nonrealtime connectivity, such as large research institutions or hospitals, which need to periodically synchronize a large amount of data with a data center or cloud. In this mode, customers can obtain higher experience services with lower tariffs, and carriers can better utilize idle bandwidth resources to obtain more value without disrupting existing business. Figure 37 on the next page illustrates IDAN phase II. Figure 37 IDANPhase 2  TMF921 Intent red lollipop for AN IG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0  TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 65 of 105  Business layer  refers to the spot pricing business model to enable users to obtain services with a higher user experience at lower tariffs.  Service layer  translates the service intent through the Intent Management Function IMF, creates the service order for crossdomain and crossvendor service orchestration and works with servicebased assurance to close the assurance loop.  Resource layer  uses intentbased interfaces to drive fast service provisioning and network slicing at the network layer, and triggers agile and intelligent fault diagnosis and rectification based on alarms. The Catalyst developed a complete intent interface from swagger to user guide to fully working reference implementation as a formal contribution to TMF921 Intent management API and the associated intent ontology Turtle to make the intent approach more concrete and real. Figure 38 shows how the Catalyst uses multiple innovations to create a uniform yet flexible interface that allows the intentdriven approach to be applied to not only dynamic pricing but to any use case of scale across AN. Figure 38 Intent can be applied to any AN use case 4.2.11. Intentdriven Service Grading Experience Assurance As is known to all, the communications industry, as the basic industry of national economy and peoples livelihood, shoulders the mission of ensuring national construction and the normal operation of various industries, and is the cornerstone of social development. In daily life, communication assurance is the most common scenario, ranging from important meetings, earthquake relief, entertainment, and sporting games. CSPs often need to guarantee the proper implementation of communication activities and avoid communication faults caused by unexpected problems, which has a great negative impact on the entire major event. Traditional service assurance has the following disadvantages  High technical requirements and high requirements for guaranty personnel.  It is difficult to respond to service changes and emergencies in a timely manner.  The guaranteed effect is not obvious, and user experience cannot be guaranteed. IG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0  TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 66 of 105  It is difficult to support continuous assurance, and the assurance strategy cannot be flexibly adjusted with the changes of network conditions. With the wide introduction and application of intelligent technologies in the 5G era, the requirements for intelligent, simple, and derisky communication assurance are increasingly urgent. In this context, the time has come to integrate Intent Network into the mainstream business scenarios in the communications field. Functions The IntentDriven Service Grading Experience Guarantee Project changes the OM mode from How to do to What to do for the first time in the industry to guarantee the topspeed service experience guarantee driven by natural language and zeroprocess intervention.  The network intelligently translates the intent entered by a user with a natural language.  The network provides selfadaptive assurance for a type of specific services based on translation, and the assurance is divided into multiple levels as required.  The network automatically perceives the scenario of service assurance, and dynamically adjusts the assurance policy to ensure that the effect continuously meets the standard. These functions ensure that the user experience of services in specific scenarios reaches the desired level, and thus provide real network assurance with good understanding. Benefits This case verified the commercial use of Tencent video playing, live streaming, Minzhengtong QR scanning and WeChat video conferencing services. In the actual verification, each guaranteed level of different applications has been verified many times. The highest throughput can be increased by 760.55, and the lowest delay can be reduced by 88.70. Compared with the traditional assurance mode, the assurance efficiency is increased by five times. The economic benefits of this case are mainly to save and assurance human and material costs, and to assure the benefits of new traffic on sites.

Efficient OM 4.3.1. China Mobile New Radio NR Network Coverage Optimization Massive MIMO is an evolved form of multipleantenna technology, which is widely regarded as a key 5G network technology. This technology integrates more radio frequency RF channels and antennas to implement threedimensional precise beam forming and multistream multiuser multiplexing. Massive MIMO achieves better coverage and larger capacity than traditional technologies. In contrast with 4G massive MIMO that supports more than 200 broadcast beam combinations, 5G massive MIMO supports thousands of broadcast beam combinations. The pattern adjustment scope varies according to AAU types. Pure manual configuration and adjustment of broadcast beam combinations cannot achieve the optimal performance of massive MIMO due to its complexity. When massive MIMO modules are deployed on a large scale, the adjustment workload is heavy, and it is challenging to complete the adjustment manually. According to the test results of multiple CSPs on the live network, massive MIMO intelligent optimization can improve the reference signal received power RSRP and user equipment UE throughput while maximizing CSPs ROI. To meet the challenges brought by largescale commercial rollout of 5G networks, the online massive MIMO intelligent optimization solution can automatically collect basic network data, automatically analyze and generate optimization solutions based on drive tests data, and directly evaluate online KPIs in real time. This solution effectively resolves weak coverage, interference, and co coverage problems, improves coverage gains, and ensures user throughput.  Optimization Intent Delivery Obtains coverage optimization areas and objectives, such as the proportion of weak coverage areas from the service management layer.  Data Selfawareness Through the scenariooriented API obtains drive test data, performance counters, traffic statistics, engineering parameters, configuration parameters and other basic information including electronic maps, antenna patterns, frequency bands, and AAU types.  Policy Selfgeneration and Selfexecution Performs iterative reinforcement AI learning based on the preset optimization objectives to obtain the optimal optimization advice. It automatically delivers the massive MIMO pattern parameter combination, down tilt, and azimuth parameters of problematic cells and their neighboring cells based on the Massive MIMO pattern common AI model.  Data Selfanalysis Creates grids for DTMR data, identifies problematic grids, and merges them into problematic areas. The RAN Manager selects the best scenariobased beam, azimuth, and down tilt configurations for problematic cells. In this step, antenna hardware must meet the corresponding configuration requirements. In a typical operator application scenario, the RAN Manager wireless resource management layer interconnects with the network management system NMS service management layer through an open API. The NMS delivers the network coverage optimization objectives and areas to be optimized to the RAN Manager. The RAN manager sends the final optimization result and optimization advice of each round to the NMS of the operator. IG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0  TM Forum 2023.

China Mobile Zerotouch Reliability guarantee of 5G network automated faults handling With the rapid growth of 5G networks the average daily network alarms from provincial subsidiaries exceed 10 million, involving multiple network domains, long collaborative chain and complex dependency relationships. With the development of 5G to B services, enterprise customers have higher requirements for network fault detection and processing efficiency. They therefore urgently need to transform to the predictive and preventive maintenance mode that integrates humanmachine and datadriven services to improve fault selfguaranteed and selfhealing capabilities. The Zerotouch Reliability guarantee of 5G network business solution uses single domain autonomy and crossdomain collaboration as the core principle to build a fault management framework with comprehensive realtime sensing, automatic anomaly diagnosis, and intelligent decisionmaking.  Singledomain autonomy The resource operation layer improves the self guaranteed capabilities of wireless, transmission, and core network domains, including the largecapacity alarm processing capability of 2000 alarms per second, the 10001 alarm compression capability, and the network configuration capability of 800 atomic networks for the service operation layer to support fault selfhealing.

Figure 41 Zerotouch Reliability guarantee of 5G network This solution has been deployed in multiple provincial and municipal subnets of China Mobile. After applying in the network, main faults such as batch base station out of service can be cleared within 30 minutes, with average processing efficiency increased by 40. The number of invalid work orders is reduced by more than 20. The fault handling efficiency of frontline maintenance personnel is improved by 80, and that of secondline maintenance personnel is improved by 25. The autonomous network level has increased from L2 to L3. 4.3.3. China Telecom Agile Provisioning of 5G Customized Network As a key cloudnetwork convergence product, China Telecoms 5G customized network is a comprehensive solution featuring network customization, edge intelligence, cloud collaboration, and X ondemand. The company aims to build integrated, customized and converged services for customers and implement cloud network convergence and ondemand customization. However, the 5G customized network solution involves many professional networks, systems and service industries. In addition, due to the short commercial use time, obstacles such as too many handling steps, difficult requirement translation, slow resource survey, and high proportion of manual orchestration and configuration still exist during service provisioning. It will take a long time to realize ultrapremium services. IG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0  TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 70 of 105 Solution China Telecom has developed the agile provisioning for 5G customized network solution. Combined with the threelayer architecture of ANs, this solution focuses on the autonomous capability of cloud network operations. The resource operations layer aims to achieve singledomain autonomy and enables upperlayer applications, improving network situation selfawareness and facilitating network selfconfiguration. On the business and service operations layers, China Telecom first aims to improve customer experience and build capabilities such as e commerce service and intentbased requirement translation. To improve resource utilization and ensure service quality, China Telecom is attempting is to generate end toend autonomous capabilities, including online resource survey, automatic orchestration and scheduling, and automatic generation of a configuration solution. Figure 42 depicts the solution architecture, and a more detailed description follows.

Most of China Telecoms provincial subsidiaries have launched function modules including automatic provisioning, automatic change, automatic unsubscription, and troubleshooting in their production systems. These modules support agile service provisioning, including 5G slice private lines and super number cards, shortening the provisioning time from two to four weeks to instant availability and greatly improving customer experience. By the end of 2021, China Telecom had provisioned nearly 500 5G slice private lines, generating total revenue of 270 million Yuan 39.6 million. 4.3.4. China UnicomSmart Operation of 5G Bearer Network Zero Waiting Provisioning and Confirmatory SLA Guarantee With the rapid deployment of 5G networks, the provisioning efficiency and SLA assurance capability of 5G bearer networks are one of the key areas of concern for CSPs. There are challenges to automating this capability Challenges Reasons Service provisioning Provisioning is mainly dependent on manual operations. The workload varies greatly between peaks and valleys, making it difficult to balance the staffing and utilization benefits. Offline resource allocation, conflictprone, and difficult resource recycling. Many manual configurations are prone to errors. Work order record input involves data synchronization in multiple systems. SLA assurance The legacy quality test cannot ensure consistency with actual service SLA. Across the technology domain fault locating takes days or weeks. Long fault recovery time The insufficient capability of automatically monitoring service SLAs Hopbyhop fault locating cannot be implemented and difficult. The switchover is lack of automatic and intelligent optimization methods.

MTNBuilding an AllOptical Automated Network to Enable Agile Business and Intelligent OM The digital economy and digital transformation of industries pose new requirements for CSPs network capabilities and operations. An intelligent, native, efficient and reliable network with deterministic experience is now the development direction for future networks. MTN is actively carrying out network digital transformation in line with its IG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0  TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 73 of 105 Ambition 2025 strategy, MTN promotes the exploration, practice and application innovation of autonomous networks based on optical network automation scenarios. Challenges With the deployment of optical infrastructure networks and the rapid development of optical services, MTN is facing challenges in terms of time to market TTM and OM efficiency. Table 9 describes the challenges. Challenge Root Cause Description Long TTM for services The offline route design and service provisioning need to be manually performed, which is time and effortconsuming and leads to low efficiency. The offline system resource check is time and effortconsuming, and the data is inaccurate. Inefficient OM Fiber and OCh faults frequently occur, and most of them are slow change faults, which are difficult to detect in advance. Fiber cuts have a great impact on services, but there is no reliable OM method available to reduce the impact and prevent future fiber cuts. Table 9 Optical network challenges Solutions and benefits With the intelligent management and control system as the core, the alloptical AN solution introduces AI to the NE, network and service layers to implement efficient OM of alloptical networks and provide industry customers with zerotouch, zerowait and zerofault premium private line service experience. Figure 44 shows the approach, and a more detailed explanation follows. Figure 44 Alloptical AN with intelligent management and control system IG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0  TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 74 of 105 Resource closed loop  Agile service provisioning  to shorten the service TTM, improve the service gotomarket pace and accelerate business monetization, automatic service provisioning is provided for MTN in South Africa. The simplified model of automatic service provisioning and multifactor route calculation policies the most comprehensive routing policies in the industry, meeting differentiated market requirements greatly improve the onetime service provisioning success rate, shortening the TTM from weeks to minutes and providing the ultimate service experience with zerowait time.  Optical network resource assurance  in the resource check phase before service provisioning, the resource visualization function of the optical network resource assurance solution is utilized to implement minuteslevel resource check, improving service provisioning efficiency. Additionally, based on historical data, AI algorithms can be used to predict resource requirements in the next 12 months, facilitating capacity expansion in advance and eliminating the need for frequent emergency capacity expansion.  Optical network health assurance  in terms of OM efficiency improvement, the focus is on tackling frequent fiber and OCH deterioration faults that cannot be detected in advance. For this purpose, the optical network health assurance solution has been introduced in the MTN project in South Africa. Based on rich optical sensors, big data collection and analysis, and AI algorithmbased prediction capabilities, this solution helps analyze the health status of each fiber and OCH on the entire network in real time, predicts fiber fault risks and fault locations in advance, and provides handling suggestions, realizing proactive OM. The solution helps MTN identify more than 95 of fiber and OCH deterioration faults in advance, reducing the faultlocating duration by 83 and reducing fiber cuts by 30.  Optical Availability Assurance  high availability is the lifeline of networks and services. However, MTN lacks a method to measure the service availability for long periods of time. The lack of monitoring, risk identification and proactive optimization suggestions for availability severely restricts service development. Now, the optical availability assurance solution has been applied to the MTN project in Nigeria. Through the multidimensional evaluation and analysis for fiber and service availability, fiber cut impact and service protection risks, this solution proactively identifies potential risks of fiber service availability, monitors service availability in real time, automatically generates warnings when thresholdcrossing occurs and provides optimization suggestions. In this way, rectification can be performed in advance to realize a highly reliable network with zerofault. Service closed loop Based on the internal collaboration of service, performance, and resource management systems, the multidomain decisionmaking capability is enhanced, and AI is introduced to drive multidomain closedloop management and support automated service operations. Business closed loop With the network capabilities provided by the intelligent management and control system at the resource operations and the operation support capabilities provided by the service operations, the business operations provide customers with ecommerce and selfservice experience, including online service subscription, bandwidth on demand and realtime service SLA performance query, customers can enjoy self service network management services anytime and anywhere.

MTNFault ManagementClosed Loop Automation A key challenge in operation was resolving complicated crossdomain faults where the problem could be in the RAN, Core, TRX or IPRAN. When such problems are detected, the staff has to collect data manually from various sources and need experts in various fields to do the analysis. Demarcating the fault can take hours and finding the root cause can take days depending on the complexity of the problem. To overcome this challenge, a Closed Loop Automation use case was implemented in the Intelligent Fault Management iFM module of the OSS platform called AUTIN. As shown in the diagram below the idea is to take people out of the loop and let the platform leveraging on AI resolve the issue through selfhealing. Figure 45 Cognitive closed loop IG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0  TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 76 of 105 Architecture and Solution Figure 46 Architecture and Solution The diagram above shows the 4 stages of the cognitive closed loop automation which are described below  Awareness The group of tasks that monitor and understands what happened or about to happen in qualitystate of networkservices. It collects multi dimensional data from all domains such as RAN, Core, TRX, MW etc. and can detect network quality degradation based on dynamic threshold monitoring model.  Analysis The group of tasks which analyze information generated in the awareness phase using technologies such as AI inference for topology generation and crossdomain alarm correlation to demarcate where the problem lies. For analysis it has various capabilities such as single domain fault identification and crossdomain power and environment fault identification models. Topology can be generated for both mobile and fixed networks and reduces problem demarcation from hours to less than 5 mins.  Decision The group of tasks that decide the necessary management operation for execution e.g., network configuration or adjustment. Here it leverages on various diagnosis trees such as fault root cause diagnosis model and performance degradation diagnosis model for RCA Root Cause Analysis. Currently these diagnosis trees cover 70 of network problems with an RCA accuracy of 90.  Execution The group of tasks which executes the management operations and feedback the result. Where configuration changes are required to resolve the problem, the platform can make many of the changes by itself without people intervention. This means selfhealing or zero touch for these scenarios. IG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0  TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 77 of 105 Impact of Closed Loop Automation For MTN this use case improved its network availability by between 0.05 and 0.1. It also reduced MTTR and revenue loss. The topology generation with its autodiscovery feature enabled visual trouble shooting and faster fault demarcation. The AABD Automatic Alarm Behavior Discovery functionality supports root cause alarm identification for crossdomain and complicated faults, and the open APIs supports MTNs Autonomous Network journey. An example of a value for MTN was in RAN sleeping cell detection. Previously MTN had to do manual inspection to identify sleeping cells which can take more than 3 days. When the use case was implemented in one of the Opcos which had over 100,000 logical cells covering 2G3G4G the faulty cells were detected immediately and resolved remotely through selfhealing which reduced the annual revenue loss. By 2023 MTN is expected to implement this use case in all 20 Opcos covering over 300 million subscribers. 4.3.7.

This moves us a step closer to evolving to a higherlevel of autonomous network operations. 4.3.8. Hitless Automatic Upgrade of 5G Core Network NEs In the 5G era, various industries are undergoing rapid digital transformation and posing numerous requirements, which in turn is triggering more frequent version upgrades. Traditionally, these upgrades are performed frequently at the NE level, which interrupts services, affects user stability, and hinders innovation and service development. During NE upgrades, users are reregistered or reactivated, and data and voice services are interrupted, affecting user experience. The following are key challenges  Complex upgrade process  an upgrade involves complex preparations and procedures and many manual operations. Leading carriers usually have hundreds of sites, and upgrades can be performed only at night.  Long interruption during upgrades  before an upgrade, users must be migrated or pooled. Otherwise, services will be interrupted. It takes 15 to 20 minutes to activate and upload software and restore services.  All resources required for hitless upgrade  all resources need to be reserved for hitless upgrade, resulting in wasted resources.

Intelligent Cloud Core Network OM The core network is the brain of the telecom network and is responsible for scheduling and managing global network resources. The core network serves a large number of users and has a wide impact scope in case of faults. Therefore, stability is a top priority for the core network. 5G allcloud core networks are being rapidly deployed and are seeing largescale commercial use. These networks have introduced NFV, slicing, and MEC technologies. Core networks are becoming increasingly complex and are witnessing a 100fold increase in the number of maintenance objects, and increasingly frequent change operations. Traditional manual operations cannot meet new OM requirements and face the following fault management challenges  Preevent Network anomalies are difficult to monitor, and faults are passively detected.  Inevent Crosslayer and crossNE fault demarcation is difficult. Faults continue to create more negative impacts.  Postevent No ground is provided for DR switchovers. Unnecessary DR switchovers may cause even more service failures. To overcome these challenges, carrier A and Huawei jointly developed an intelligent core network OM solution. Based on the intelligent engine and expertise, a complete fault management scheme is provided at the management and control layer to implement proactive fault prevention, quick fault handling, and lossless fault rectification, fully improving core network reliability.  Intelligent fault detection Various machine learning algorithms are used to infer the dynamic threshold ranges of KPIs for anomaly detection, shortening the detection time from several hours to just 5 minutes. The anomaly identification accuracy reaches over 85. The troubleshooting mode is transformed from complaintdriven passive OM to proactive prevention based on prediction.  Intelligent fault diagnosis Noise reduction, correlation, and aggregation are performed for abnormal KPIs, logs, and alarms in order to comprehensively analyze fault information in terms of space and time, and efficiently demarcate NFV crosslayer and horizontal issues. Faults can be demarcated at the minimum recoverable unit level within 10 minutes, significantly shortening the demarcation duration and saving time for DR operations, if any.  Intelligent DR assistance To tackle major core network faults, optimal parameter solving based on AI flow control and signaling impact simulation are used to quickly evaluate a DR switchover. Faults can be rectified within 15 minutes, ensuring a successful DR switchover at one stroke. IG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0  TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved.

The solution has been piloted and verified in many provinces in China, including Henan, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang. The test results show that the solution can greatly improve the efficiency and intelligent level of core network troubleshooting, helping the carrier reach AN L3 and evolve towards L4. 4.3.10. Wireless Network  Intelligent Fault Management Based on Prediction Intelligent wireless network fault management happens in three stages 1. Automatic ticket processing, which significantly improves maintenance efficiency 2. Proactive maintenance based on prediction and prevention technologies 3. Providing a highly reliable selfsensing and selfhealing mobile network featuring intelligent OM based on advanced perception capabilities and various technologies, including intentdriven and levelbased collaboration. Most CSPs are at the first stage, but pioneering CSPs are developing automatic troubleshooting capabilities and shifting their focus to intelligent troubleshooting. In recent years, many have posed requirements on the scope of fault prediction capability in terms of many aspects, from strategic indicators to platform capability development. This is because wireless networks have always faced issues such as potential fault points, various fault symptoms and complex fault causes hardware, software, external system, environment and human factors, and a combination of active and passive faults such as passive fronthaul, power and environment, and device faults. They also use different faultdetection methods and granularities and have complex onsite troubleshooting and inspection operations. These issues create daunting challenges to the development of intelligent wireless fault capabilities, such as precise identification, demarcation and locating, troubleshooting and inspection and prediction. Predictive and proactive OM Huawei has proposed a wide range of solutions based on the AN architecture with IntelligentRAN to overcome these challenges and facilitate the evolution towards Autonomous Networks. These solutions enhance the fault detection capability to maximize the fault management scope while also achieving the optimal automation result through upperlayer and lowerlayer collaboration, crosssite collaboration and devicenetwork collaboration. IG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0  TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 82 of 105 Take the equipment high temperature prediction solution as an example. NEs self detect the temperature data of each piece of equipment in real time, selfpredict the temperature trend within a short period at the NE level and report the trend to MAE. Based on longterm data of multiple sites, MAE uses the neural network deep learning algorithm to generate a baseline AI model. Next the model will be generalized and optimized for each site or region to perform singlesite inference in order to obtain the optimal prediction result and identify risks of high temperature. The prediction capability can also be used in other scenarios, such as identifying risks of optical modules and paths. Based on the long and shortterm perception data of MAE and NEs, the subhealth status of optical components and paths can be predicted and determined. Intelligent AR inspection In the last mile practice based on devicenetwork collaboration, augmented reality AR technology is applied to site devices. Image recognition technology and devicenetwork collaboration enable automatic AR inspection, dumb resource modelling and realtime fault point identification. An intelligent wizardbased engine for troubleshooting is developed on MAE to communicate with site devices in real time to help site personnel perform efficient and accurate operations, greatly improving onsite troubleshooting efficiency. Figure 50 Equipment high temperatureoptical power prediction solution Figure 50 shows the solution, and a more detailed explanation follows.  Automatic equipment room selfinspection based on image recognition  the inspection scope covers 11 types of items and 25 subscenarios such as equipment room door locks, batteries and grounding surge protection, and 9 types of problems such as battery rust and warranty period. Engineers can quickly take pictures and inspect equipment rooms, improving singlesite inspection efficiency and ensuring that no inspection items are missed.  Proactive risk selfelimination assisted by knowledge library  inspection personnel automatically check alarms and performance of devices based on inspection rules. Abnormal incidents can be handled by referring to the online IG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0  TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 83 of 105 knowledge library of MAE. Alternatively, they can call experts for support in oneclick mode, greatly improving the efficiency of equipment room inspection and troubleshooting. Benefits The equipment high temperature prediction solution has yielded satisfactory results in China and Thailand. The accuracy of predicting high board temperatures five days ahead reaches more than 90. Possible causes and troubleshooting guidance are provided. Early troubleshooting significantly lowers the risk of base station being outof service due to high temperatures. The AR site inspection solution has been verified in many provinces and cities in China. The solution can be used to read almost all dashboards and other items that need to be read by human eyes in wireless equipment rooms, reducing the inspection duration from 70 minutes to 30 minutes compared with traditional methods. The AR assisted troubleshooting prototype solution reduces mean time to repair of fronthaul faults for onsite troubleshooting verification in typical scenarios. 4.3.11. Wireless Network  Dynamic NearRealTime Optimization Wireless networks change with the passage of time. There are changes from many aspects, including the radio environment, traffic volume, network load, user locations, and service experience. The frequencies of these changes are different, for example, longterm monthly and weekly user growth, daily and hourly tidal traffic changes, minuteslevel emergencies, and secondslevel and millisecondslevel service experience deterioration. Figure 51 Dynamic changes of wireless network traffic over time Dynamic network changes, especially those that happen within a few minutes or seconds, create tremendous challenges to network OM. When an unexpected network event occurs, traffic converges quickly, and the usage of air interface resources increases rapidly, resulting in complaints from cell edge users due to the deterioration of user experience. If such an event occurs, the experience of specific users is reduced to a level lower than that specified in the SLA, affecting the experience of the entire service. It is difficult for OM personnel to quickly monitor and respond to network or experience changes that occur within a few minutes or seconds. These frequent network changes are averaged in periodic and regional monitoring results. The impact of these changes on user experience cannot be quickly perceived. It may take one or two hours for data collection, root cause analysis, and closedloop decision making after a complaint is received. IG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0  TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 84 of 105 To address these issues caused by dynamic network changes, intelligent capabilities are introduced to mobile networks. Based on Huawei IntelligentRAN architecture, wireless NEs collaborate with MAE to quickly detect changes, and adaptively adjust and optimize networks. Solution To adapt to dynamic network changes, an intelligent network needs to provide quasi realtime optimization capabilities, including  Networklevel nearrealtime perception and prediction of network performance or experience changes.  Nearrealtime optimization and closed loop for burst traffic or experience deterioration. The solution consists of three parts time modeling, networklevel nearrealtime perception and prediction, and nearrealtime optimization and closed loop. KPI change feature extraction and time series modeling Network KPIs, such as traffic, resource usage, and throughput, of each cell change with the passage of time. Network data within a certain period can be collected to extract the features of long term and shortterm changes in order to develop a cellspecific time series model that can predict KPI changes. Networklevel nearrealtime perception and prediction of network or experience changes The time series model for network KPI changes and computing power can be leveraged to automatically identify burst traffic or experience deterioration on the entire network. The identification result can be immediately reported to the upperlayer management and control node. Collaborative intelligent identification at the network and NE levels in the intelligent architecture achieve minuteslevel and secondslevel nearrealtime prediction when compared with the traditional monitoring mode. Based on the shortterm trend, KPI trends can be predicted to identify network or experience risks. Nearrealtime optimization and closed loop of burst traffic or experience deterioration Problematic cells and correlated cells are quickly identified to provide optimization solutions including MLB parameters, multifrequency camping and mobility parameters, RF beam parameters, and power control scheduling parameters based on the topology, scenario analysis, and model technologies. Benefits In Tianjin, shopping malls and pedestrian streets are located in business districts, and residential areas are located in adjacent districts. Traffic is concentrated in different areas in different time segments shopping malls and pedestrian streets during the day, and residential areas at night. Based on the traffic changes predicted by the time series model, SSB beams of 5G cells are dynamically adjusted to increase the traffic volume and number of users by 5 to 10, while ensuring that the KPIs remain normal. In the university and industrial areas in Shandong province, traffic changes dynamically in industrial parks, urban villages, hospitals, residential areas, and secondary vocational colleges in different periods. After dynamic optimization of SSB beams in 5G cells, the traffic and number of users increase by 5 to 10, while ensuring that the KPIs remain normal.

Intelligent Locating of Optical Path Interruptions Within Milliseconds Automatic and intelligent OM for alloptical networks has always been an industry focus and a daunting challenge. The transport network is crucial to alloptical networks Any fault with the transport network will affect numerous services and a large number of customers. Line interruption is a common transport network fault. For example, a municipal subsidiary had 3,234 tickets for transport network faults in a month, among which about 50 were ETH_LOS optical path alarms. Rectifying line faults is expensive and timeconsuming with a mean time to repair MTTR of about four hours. Rectifying optical path faults involves three main challenges  It is difficult to perform fault demarcation and locating due to many potential fault points, including power and environment, equipment rooms, optical modules, optical fiber pigtails and optical cables.  The traditional method for locating optical signal LOS alarms on a peer device cannot accurately identify the root cause for example, power failure, optical cable interruption or connector disconnection.  Precision must be compromised to improve the efficiency of centrally analyzing a large amount of KPI data for example, optical power data. Solution To better predict optical path risks and accurately locate optical path interruptions, an unnamed CSP and Huawei jointly developed the millisecondlevel intelligent optical path interruption locating solution. This solution provides millisecondlevel optical power sensing capabilities for NEs, AI model optimization, and network topologybased endtoend demarcation and locating capabilities. It can quickly detect and accurately locate optical path interruption faults, improving OM efficiency. The solution architecture is shown below, and a description follows. IG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0  TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 86 of 105 Figure 53 Millisecondlevel intelligent optical path interruption locating solution  Native network intelligence  the sensing capability of optical modules on NEs is upgraded to continuously collect realtime and finegrained optical power data within milliseconds. Based on the AI capabilities of NE boards and the large data scale, the AI model for identifying optical path interruptions is continuously optimized to accurately identify optical path interruptions caused by power failures, pigtail disconnection and optical cable interruption.  Singledomain autonomy and crossdomain collaboration  the optical module of an NE collects data and caches data within a short period. The edge AI module of the main control board of the device performs local analysis to demarcate and locate the causes of interruption at the NE level. The NMS identifies singledomain faults based on the network topology and automatically starts fault demarcation and locating, achieving singledomain autonomy. Key data in the demarcation and locating result is reported to the upperlayer system to enable crossdomain collaboration. Benefits This solution has been piloted and verified on networks in many provinces, including Henan and Guangdong. A full 77 of faults can be located within just a few minutes with an accuracy of 95. The average troubleshooting efficiency is improved by 30. The troubleshooting efficiency of frontline and secondline maintenance personnel is also significantly increased, reducing unnecessary site visits. 4.3.13. AIIntellectualized OM management Traditional ways of handling OM are facing many challenges including opaque system rules, inconsistent data management, fragmented business processes, slow demand response and high development costs. It is urgent to build an OM capability platform and apply AI to realize full lifecycle management of business processes, automation processes, agile development and selfservice. IG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0  TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 87 of 105 Architecture and solution The architecture for the AIintellectualized OM management solution, shown in Figure 51, has several goals  Extracting the common capabilities of electronic OM systems, substitute maintenance systems and materials management systems  Building an AI capability support system for OM management with unified processes and users and data integration  Realizing endtoend penetration of OM workflows Improving the efficiency and intelligence of OM work scheduling  Providing crosslayer and crossdomain process selfmonitoring and self service for all business systems in the OSS domain. Figure 54 AI Intellectualized OM management solution The AIintellectualized OM management solution realizes automation and intelligence of OM in the following ways  Visualized fault closed loop  when a fault event is triggered, the processing group personnel and all task lists to be executed are automatically matched according to the scheduling process configuration. The task can be presented quickly to realize the visual closed loop of the work order and fault self monitoring.  Intelligent work order quality inspection  analyzes the assessment intention of the manager and completes mass work order quality inspection through intelligent methods with AI training instead of manual. It promotes the standardization of fault handling process and improves the efficiency of OM management from the perspective of the authenticity of fault recovery and the normalization of work order response.  Automatic patrol inspection of network management  analyzes the intention of patrol inspection objectives and scenarios, automatically selects the corresponding operation plan and completes the distribution to realize the unified management and scheduling of crossdomain and crossintegrated network management intelligent patrol inspection.

Application and outcome This solution has been tested and verified in the OM management of Anhui Mobile, Sichuan Mobile, Hunan Mobile, China Unicom Group and other provincial operator, where is has improved OM efficiency and ANL.  The intelligent quality inspection method has been deployed and applied in wireless, transmission, data, and other fields. The coverage rate of intelligent quality inspection is 99, and the accuracy rate of intelligent quality inspection reached 95.  The quality inspection efficiency is reduced from 9 people per month to 1 person per month. The intelligent quality inspection capability of fault work orders has been deployed in AI midplatform. The AN level of work order quality inspection reached L3 in Q4 2021. The demander can directly invoke it. Nowadays, the average number of invoking per month has reached 454,000. 4.3.14. Intelligent Automatic Verification of Dumb Resources Based on AI Technology Dumb resource management is the vital and difficult task of resource operation and plays a decisive role in resource management. The dumb resources refer to the network element resources that cannot be automatically collected by the operation and maintenance system. In simple terms, they are resources which cannot speak and have no initiative. The amount of dumb resource data is huge and cannot be automatically collected, and the accuracy of dumb resources seriously affects the planning and construction, business scheduling, business monitoring and other service operations, and then affects the users experience and business operation and maintenance procedure which penetrates the network domain, operation and maintenance domain and business domain. IG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0  TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 89 of 105 Figure 55 Intelligent Automatic Verification of Dumb Resources Based on AI Technology In order to manage dumb resources and change the phenomenon that the input of resource data is inconsistent with the actual situation on the site, it is necessary to establish a centralized resource management system, which is relied on the production process of various resource management such as embedded network and inventory check, and collect immediate resource data and longitude and latitude dot photos on the site with the intelligent APP. The resource information will be stored into database and archived only after the audit by backend. The resource audit has become a very important work in the current dumb resource management. There are many issues about the accuracy which is judged by manually comparing with the onsite photos and data in the current audit stage  The Innumerable work orders make the audit pressure enormously the number of dumb resources in a certain province of China Mobile is nearly 150 million, the monthly average audit work orders is more than 10000, and the average monthly audit pictures are more than 100000. At the same time, the audit work should be embedded in production, and the audit time limit is short, so these factors result in enormous audit pressure.  Due to relying on manual audit, the audit standards are not unified dumb resources cannot be automatically collected, and their accuracy must be IG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0  TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 90 of 105 checked by audit. However, the audit work is still conducted manually, lacking the intelligent methods.  Irregular onsite photographing procedure make great difficulty in review there are a large number of nonstandard or false photos in onsite photographing, which makes it more difficult for the backend review, resulting in a large number of invalid inputs and affecting accuracy.  Large demand for audit personnel and low audit coverage due to lack of automatic method to improve efficiency, and many ineffective inputs, the gap of audit personnel is large, so we can only spot check according to the proportion and cannot fully cover all dummy resources. According to the current situation of dumb resource management, the steps of establishing standard, intelligent audit, embedded production, automatic audit, analysis and optimization dumb resource collection and verification are proposed, and a new dumb resource management system of intelligent and automatic verification shall be established. Establishing onsite image collection specifications according to the standard specifications of resource onsite image collection, add image acquisition verification in dumb resource onsite APP to effectively guide onsite construction personnel. Building AI intelligent audit capability composed the AI capability of the intelligent midplatform and the selfbuilt twodimensional code identification capability and build up AI intelligent audit methods such as onsite resource type identification, name identification, location comparison and twodimensional code identification. Embedded AI capability in production  automatic audit combined with AI capability and automatic audit model, audit and control the scenario processes of centralized resource creation, cutover, error correction and inventory inspection, it can effectively reduce the workload of manual audit. Analysis and Optimization provide statistical analysis report of collector portrait, work order automatic audit and picture AI intelligent audit. The personnel are assessed and analyzed through the portraits, and the onsite photographing problems are summarized through the analysis of the AI intelligent audit results. The photographing specifications are optimized according to the problems, forming positive closed loop. The solution has been put into practice in China Mobiles branches in many provinces and achieved remarkable results. Taking a provincial branch as an example, after the intelligent automatic verification of dumb resources was launched, the audit efficiency was significantly improved, and the labor cost was reduced. The AN level can reach L4 in the related rating.  There are 15,000 monthly audit work orders in this province, the automatic audit success rate can reach 90  after deploying the Intelligent Automatic Verification System of Dumb Resources. There is an average of 1000 times per day for invoking AI identification capability of smart midplatform, 3000 times per day for invoking OCR capability, and 2000 times per day for invoking QR code identification.  The audit time of single work order is shortened from 180s to 60s, and the time consumption is reduced by 66.67.  438 hours of labor hours can be saved every month, 5255 hours per year, and 93.33 of audit labor can be reduced.

Endtoend Crosslayer Network Fault Location Solution Based on NFVNetwork Function Virtualization, the core network is constructed on three layers application layer, virtual layer and physical layer and multiple VNFs share the resource pools. Service fault location is more complicated than that of traditional devices. In general, network faults have the maximum ratio, the greatest impact, and the greatest analysis difficulty among service faults. So rapid delimitation and location of network faults has become a key point for troubleshooting in the NFV architecture. Crosslayer diagnosis and analysis of network faults are very difficult, and have the following challenges  Unclear Network Topology Complicated and dynamic network topology is caused by network virtualization, and visual network topology is not available.  More Potential Fault Points VM  Virtual NIC  Virtual switch  Physical network interface TOREOR switch  router. Longer traffic forwarding path increases fault points and it is more difficult to delimit the faults.  Difficult to Implement Traditional Packetcapturing Unclear topology and complicated types of faulty protocols, and packetcapturing is too difficult to implement.  Lack of EndtoEnd Location Method The existing network fault location tools only support singlelayer fault location without interlayer endtoend fault location measures crossing application layer, virtual layer, and physical layer. Endtoend crosslayer network fault location solution integrates the fault location capabilities of three layers under the NFV architecture. From the application layer top down, it breaks through the capability barriers of each layer, and integrates the fault information of each layer, so as to realize fast crosslayer fault delimitation and location. This solution achieves closed loop at the resource layer in CN autonomous domain and supports the service layer to achieve closed loop of services. In this way, selfmonitoring, selfreporting, and selfanalysis capabilities are improved in an all round way, and the core network can achieve selfintelligence network of L3. Figure 56 shows the architecture of the endtoend crosslayer network fault location solution.

China Mobile Green and Intelligent Optical CrossConnect  OXC  Network Development of services such as 5G, cloud and eastern data and western computing , as well as customers demands for green energy saving and zerowait ANs, transmission network nodes face unparalleled challenges in capacity, energy saving, latency and autonomy. At the same time, the traditional optical switching solution occupies a large amount of cabinet resource, fiber patch cords between cabinets and much energy. Therefore, a new optical technology solution is badly needed. To meet the lowlatency and intelligent OM requirements of premium private lines, CSPs must greatly accelerate the deployment and expansion of optical paths to achieve singleday service provisioning and intelligent assurance. Solution OXC supports singledomain autonomy and enables resource closed loops. The company pioneered the adoption of multidimensional, alloptical OXC technology on intelligent transmission NEs to accelerate singledomain autonomy, save energy and enable intelligent OM. In addition, network capabilities are open to enable agile business. OXC replaces the traditional opticaltoelectrical conversion, thereby achieving high integration, lowenergy consumption, zero fiber connection and simplified OM. In addition, the network architecture is optimized Meshnet, leading to a significant decrease in latency and increase in transmission network quality see Figure 58. Figure 58 Architecture of a green and intelligent OXC network Application and benefits OXC lays a green, autonomous, alloptical foundation for the development of premium private lines. It reduces the space needed for transmission devices by up to 90 and cuts their energy consumption by 60, respectively, with no fiber connection at sites. In terms of transmission latency, it forms a 10ms latency circle around cities, facilitating more efficient operations of premium private lines. Provincial branches such as China Mobile Jiangsu have joined hands with Huawei to deploy the OXC technology. This move helps them save space amounting to 216 opticallayer and 42 electricallayer standard transmission racks in their transmission backbone equipment rooms. For the 34 optimized nodes, China Mobile Jiangsu estimates its energy savings to be 1.3 million kilowatts a year, with a 45 reduction in energy consumption.

Page 95 of 105 By adjusting the network structure, the operating company effectively reduced the transmission latency, with intraprovince transmission latency cut by 33. This ensures the quality and experience of 5G private networks and transmission private lines and builds a solid technical foundation for Autonomous Networks. 4.4.2. China Mobile Dynamic Energy Saving With Slicing Packet NetworkSPN In 2021, China Mobiles energy consumption costs were 36.878 billion Yuan 5.4 billion, and the transmission network accounts for about 510 of the total. China Mobile is developing the SPN for 5G slicing of the transport network, which will reduce energy consumption. Service volume on the SPN transport network gradually increases with continuous development of enterprise private line services. Service traffic changes with time and shows an obvious tidal effect there is a large difference in loads between peak and off peak hours. However, the energy consumption of network devices does not change when service loads vary. Instead, they always consume energy at full load, resulting in unnecessary waste. CSPs must find ways to formulate dynamic energysaving policies and properly set energysaving parameters in order to implement refined and dynamic adjustment of energy consumption while ensuring network experience. Service KPIs must not deteriorate in energysaving mode, but the energy consumption of the entire network needs to be reduced. Solution Working with Huawei and ZTE, China Mobile built an AI system to accurately forecast link traffic trends based on historical traffic data, network topology, and service routes. This system collects network data in real time, models trafficburst patterns, intelligently analyzes service load changes, and automatically generates multilayer chipmoduleboard multimode energy saving solutions see Figure 59. This makes dynamic energy saving a reality. Figure 59 AI platform for dynamic energy saving IG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0  TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved.

Base Station Online Energy Saving As CSPs network energy consumption keeps increasing, reducing the energy consumption of the main equipment is key to delivering energy savings. Reducing the IG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0  TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 99 of 105 power consumption of the main equipment at wireless sites has become the top priority for all. The network traffic volume varies greatly during peak and offpeak hours. Despite this, the equipment keeps running, and the power consumption is not dynamically adjusted based on the traffic volume, resulting in energy wastage. In a typical network, the features of different scenarios vary greatly. How we automatically identify different scenarios and formulate appropriate energysaving policies becomes the key to energy saving. The solution involves providing automation capabilities for the service management layer and resource management layer. Based on networklevel AIbased intelligent energy saving policy management and site energy saving scheduling control, the mobile network energy saving solution implements network scene adaption, one site one policy, and multinetwork collaboration for intelligent base station energy saving management.
