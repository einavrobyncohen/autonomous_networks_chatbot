Autonomous Network An Autonomous Network is a system of networks and software platforms that are capable of sensing its environment and adapting its behavior accordingly with little or no human input. Autonomous Network Level AN Levels describe the level of autonomic capability in a given operational workflow or for an autonomous domain L0L5. AN Levels identify contextual autonomous capability. Control loop Control loops are used to enable autonomous systems to adapt their behavior to respond to changes in user needs, business goals, or environmental conditions. For full list of terms related to autonomous networks see IG1230. IG1252 Autonomous Network Levels Evaluation Methodology v1.1.0  TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 9 of 54 2. Scope of Document This document defines the Autonomous Networks Level based on TM Forum IG1218, IG1230, and serves as the autonomous level evaluation component of the Autonomous Network Maturity Model. It describes the concepts of Autonomous Networks Level, which include Autonomous Networks Level methodology and approach, operational processes, their underlying subprocesses and tasks, task evaluation criteria etc., and finally establishes a standardized evaluation approach for assessing in an offline manner the Autonomous Networks Level of a network, or part of a network. Note The current version 1.1.0 does not cover business operation layer, and it will be extended in the future version. IG1252 Autonomous Network Levels Evaluation Methodology v1.1.0  TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 10 of 54 3. Background, Benefits, and Usage 3.1. Background and benefits A common understanding of the levels of autonomous network will be helpful to the telecommunications industry. The operators operational and management efforts and dedicated human resources will vary according to different autonomous networks levels. It would be beneficial for operators to have clear view on the expectation of the level of their network s to indicate the maturity of the network autonomy, so that they could firstly focus on the important features which should be prioritized to achieve a certain level of autonomy in their networks. This approach will help operators to smoothly migrate to a higher autonomy level and a better operational efficiency. Several standards development organizations SDOs have been trying to assess the different levels of network automation across different service providers and enterprise businesses. However, the reference guidelines in systematic evolution of automation and quantized measurement methods are still unclear. The clearly defined autonomous network levels in this document has the following benefits  Providing guidance to operators, vendors and other participants of the telecommunications industry for roadmap planning.  Providing reference for gap and priority analysis for future work on network autonomy.  Providing a basis for measuring the level of an autonomous network, or autonomous network feature, along with its components and workflows.  Providing detailed processoriented approach and effectoriented metrics to achieve quantized evaluation. 3.2. Usage of this document The document is intended to be used by service providers and solution provider to help them in conducting high level autonomy assessments of their existing network and system, identifying their maturity and specific areas for future improvement. The baseline process structure used within the methodology may vary slightly from one operator to the next. A service provider can, if required, adapt the flows or structures to suit their own environment. The evaluation methodology remains fully valid, thus has broad applicability.

Autonomous network levels The work done in SAEMOTORLEV was the original inspiration for autonomous network levels. Automation can be applied to four broad classes of functions information acquisition, information analysis, decision and action selection, action implementation. Within each of these types, automation can be applied across a continuum of levels from low to high, i.e., from fully manual to fully automatic. A particular system can involve automation of all four types at different levels MODLEVELTYPE. Based on these frameworks for automation, the autonomous network level methodology has been designed, shown in Table 41. Table 41. Autonomous network level methodology PPeople manualS Systems autonomous Note 1 System including management systemOM tools and network. Note 2 The table 41 is consistent with IG1218 and may be adjusted in the future version. 4.2. Characteristics and effects of autonomous network levels Based on the methodology above, the level description and the typical characteristics with expected effects of each autonomous network levels can be abstracted as shown in Table 42 Table 42. Autonomous network level characteristics and effects Level Description Typical characteristics Expected effects Level 0  Manual management All dynamic tasks have to be executed manually. Offline, Full manual OM Awareness, analysis, decision, execution and intent are fully manually accomplished. No manpower is saved. Level 1  assisted management The system executes certain repetitive sub tasks based on pre configured logic or policy to increase execution efficiency. Online, Assisted execution Awareness and execution are assisted by system. Actions of awareness, execution and intentexperience can be online recorded and traced. Part of manpower can be saved and more manpower can be focused on analysis and decision. IG1252 Autonomous Network Levels Evaluation Methodology v1.1.0  TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 12 of 54 Level Description Typical characteristics Expected effects Level 2  Partial autonomous network The system enables partial automatic OM for certain domains based on predefined rulepolicy under certain external environments. Static rulepolicy based automation Execution is automated. Some awareness and analysis functions can be accomplished for certain scenarios based on static human predefined rulespolicies. Part of manpower can be saved from simple and repetitive work on data collection, preprocessing and analysis. Level 3  Conditional autonomous network Building on L2 capabilities, the system is capable to optimize and adjust itself to the external environment under the instructions from dynamic rulespolicies. Dynamic rulepolicy based automation Awareness, execution and most analysis are automated. Scenario decoupled common rulespoliciesAI models which can be dynamically updated. Some automatic decision making can be achieved under human predefined rulepolicy. Level 4  High autonomous network Building on L3 capabilities, the system enables AI assisted automation capability that is capable of automated continuous learning and rapid evolution. AI assisted automation capable of continuous learning and rapid evolution Awareness, analysis, decision, and execution are automated, intentexperience driven closedloop control can be accomplished for certain scenarios under human supervision in emergency situations. Most of the manpower can be focused on expert experience, AI model management, and novel or unsupported scenarios. Level 5  Full autonomous network This level is the endgoal for telecom network evolution. The system possesses autonomous capabilities across the entire lifecycle for selfX management with little manual interference. Autoevolution, Full autonomy, All scenarios Awareness, analysis, decision, execution and intentexperience are autonomous. The whole autonomy mechanisms including expert experience and AI model management can be autoevolved for all scenarios. Manpower is only needed to generate intent and monitor the progress and status. Note The content related to awareness, analysis, decision, execution, intentexperience is subject to change to keep consistent with IG1218, IG1253 in the future version.

Autonomous Network Level Evaluation Procedure 5.1.1. General principles The approach is intended to provide a pragmatic assessment of nominated ASIS use cases with the view to seeing how they can benefit from autonomous networking in the future TO BE. The approach consists of selecting an operational use case in a given network domain and services domain. For the purposes of this description this is called an evaluation object. A process and task oriented decomposition is then performed on the evaluation object, using both qualitative and quantitative methods, the approximate network level is derived. Note that it is approximate, to aid process, component, and vendor assessment, and generally longer term planning. Figure 5.1. Autonomous network level approach and procedure 5.1.2. Determine the evaluation object The evaluation object is a service andor network with selected operation flow for autonomous network level evaluation. Determine the evaluation objects based on selecting an operational use case from three dimensional elements of services domain, network technology domain, and operational flows shown in Figure 52. Figure 5.2. Determine the evaluation object IG1252 Autonomous Network Levels Evaluation Methodology v1.1.0  TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 14 of 54 5.1.3. Describe operational flow of the evaluation object AuthenticityThis should reflect the flows of the evaluation object in an actual production environment. In businessservice resource operation layer, the operational flows include Planning, Deployment, Service providing , Maintenance, and Optimization. 5.1.4. Decompose operation flows into operation tasks Each production activity can be mapped to a unique, or atomic, operation task. One production activitytomany operations task cannot exist. If one production activity is mapped to multiple standard operation tasks, the production activity needs to be further decomposed. This decomposition should continue until it is no longer possible to further break down items. 5.1.5. Assess autonomy at the task level For each task Assess the autonomy of the task based on the autonomy level evaluation criteria. Valid scores are between 1.0 manual operation and 5.0 full autonomy. 5.1.6. Calculate the score of the evaluation object level Calculate the overall autonomy level for the evaluation object level by averaging the levels for each task. Using average aggregation is relatively balanced and objective. It can reflect the overall situation of the evaluation object and avoid too many human factors such as weights which will need to be looked at as part of more detailed measurements. A final score will be between 1.0 manual operation to 5.0 full autonomy. 5.1.7. Output the overall evaluation conclusion Using the autonomy scores derived across the evaluation object, identify strengths and weaknesses, highlighting that tasks that require significant improvement. Based on the evaluation object level score calculation result and identification of strengths and weaknesses, an overall evaluation conclusion. 5.2. Autonomous network AN operation flow Based on service provider perspectives and best practices, each operational layer of the autonomous network can be decomposed to the following operation flows  Endtoend operation flows in business layer Including customer lifecycle management processes and productoffering lifecycle management processes.  Endtoend operation flows in services layer Including the flows of resourcefacing services planning, deployment, maintenance, optimization and inventory management . Also, includes the flows of customerfacing services planning, deployment, service providing, maintenance, and optimization.  Endtoend operation flows in resource layer Including the processes of resourcenetwork planning, deployment, maintenance ,optimization and inventory management. IG1252 Autonomous Network Levels Evaluation Methodology v1.1.0  TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved.

Operation flow and operation tasks Controlloops are used to describe and execute the necessary steps to fulfill certain management purposes. An operation flow is an encapsulation of one or more management tasks that exist in the context of a control loop. The autonomy capabilities of the tasks within the operation flow may impact the network autonomy level. The following are the potential categorization of the tasks in an operation flow  IntentExperience The group of tasks which translate intent from operator or customer into detailed operations which may affect one or more of the following groups of tasks i.e., awareness, analysis, decision, execution, also evaluate and feedback intent fulfilment information e.g., the intent is satisfied or not.  Awareness The group of tasks that monitor and understanding what happening or exists in qualitystate of networkservices, such as collecting networkservices information, preprocess information and selective notification, etc.  Analysis The group of tasks which analyze data generated in the awareness phase, use technologies such as model inference and analysis, make a recommendation for decision.  Decision The group of tasks that decide the necessary management operation for execution, e.g., network configuration or adjustment.  Execution The group of tasks which execute the management operations and feedback the result to the intent requester. For example, the relationship between tasks and AIbased cognitive workflow in monitoring and troubleshooting operation process is as follows  A task group of fault management policies generation and fault management intent fulfillment evaluation constitutes intent.  A task group of fault impact analyze, and display, fault identification, and risk prediction constitutes awareness.  A task group of fault demarcation fault root cause location and fault recovery solution generation constitutes analysis.  A task of fault recovery solution selection constitutes decision.  A task of fault recovery solution implementation group of solution implementation and verification constitutes execution. The principles for decomposing operation flow to operation task are as follows  Completeness All the OM must be included in the operation tasks.  Balance The sizing and granularity of each task is relatively balanced.  NonOverlapping The operation task is atomic and does not have functional overlaps with other tasks.
