All Rights Reserved. Page 7 of 17 1 Industry and Standardization Efforts 1. 1 Towards a shared vision of Autonomous Networks Autonomous Network initiatives are being progressed in multiple standards developing organizations (SDOs), such as ETSI, 3GPP, and GSMA to name but a few. An alignment on Autonomous Network concepts, a shared vision and framework would help the industry to progress in a coordinated way on this important initiative. Autonomous Networks evolution, standardization, and deployment will require an industry- wide consensus and each stakeholder will need to learn how to collaborate better to create the right approach. For standards work, SDOs will need to share early and often, align better and avoid duplication of effort. Autonomous Networks will evolve over a longer-term timeline and real solution deployments using AI that delivers a high level of network automation (AN Level 4) are expected in the next 5 years. However, it is the next 2 years that will prove crucial to its success. Concrete, tangible elements of the AN framework, generating the initial benefits and return, will deliver partially autonomous systems. These returns when reinvesting into the initiatives will bring bigger savings and the value behind AN. Standards should move fast to prepare the conditions of interoperability and commercial deployment of these autonomous systems. 1. 2 SDO Landscape Summary The challenges and opportunities of AN are significant, and no single stakeholder or SDO is capable to cover the entire end-to-end perspectives of AN. The cross- SDO, industry-level collaboration to achieve consensus of key concepts and terminologies (e. g. , AN definition, framework, autonomous networks levels) and the development of key capabilities, mechanisms, interfaces (e. g. , control loops, autonomous domains, intent) is essential to the success of AN.

# SDO Landscape

The following sub-sections list some of the recent contributions to the AN topic from various SDO organizations. 2. 1 European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) ETSI have a number of standards activities relating to Autonomous Networks: F5G (5th Generation Fixed Network), ENI (Improve operator Experience through closed loop AI), NFV (Network Function Virtualization), ZSM (Management/Automation of emerging and future networks and services). Figure 2. ETSI ISGs relating to AN (Source: ETSI 2020) Figure 2 shows the ISGs working in areas related to autonomous networks and identifies areas of contribution and convergence of scope of the various ETSI ISGs. ETSI plans to publish a whitepaper on Autonomous Networks that shows the importance of coordination and knowledge sharing between the ISGs and all involved in the extended ecosystem, including SDOs, cross-vertical organizations, open-source alliances and research groups. 2. 2 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) 3GPP SA5 has progressed the following specifications in the general area of AN:

# Architecture Framework

In Release 16, 3GPP SA5 took the architectural framework specified in GS ZSM 002 (ZSM Reference Architecture) into account. The related description has been captured in TS 28. 533 clause 5. 3 Management service deployment based on ZSM framework. Autonomous Networks Technical Architecture v1. 0. 0  TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 12 of 17

# Closed Loop Assurance

In 3GPP Release 16, 3GPP SA5 has specified the concept for open control loop and closed contro l loop, as well as use cases, requirements and a model for communication service assurance closed control loop. Corresponding contents are captured in TS 28. 535 and TS 28. 536. In 3GPP Release 17, 3GPP SA5 has started a new work item on enhanced closed loop SLS assurance. Classification of Network Autonomy for Fault recovery ( 28. 810) In addition, SA5 is currently working on the following Rel-17 topics that are relevant to AN: Intent driven management service for mobile networks (see TR 28. 812/TS 28. 312), Management Data Analytics Service (see TR 28. 809), Autonomous Network Levels (see TR 28. 810/TS 28. 100). 3GPP has also established the NWDAF (network data analytics function) working group to work on 5G slicing and intelligent application research of 5G Core. 2. 3 International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication (ITU-T) The ITU-T approved ITU-T Y. 3172 in June 2019 to define the network AI framework, including the intelligence level, data processing standards, and cases. The Focus group on Machine Learning for Future Networks including 5G (FG-ML5G) has developed an Architectural framework for machine learning in future networks including IMT-2020. The topics are related to Autonomous Networks but differ in focus and emphasis to the TM Forum work. The group has published deliverables on architectural framework, high-level architecture, requirements and discussed topics such as intent, machine learning, orchestrator, ML pipeline, and the need for ML sandboxes. Four important areas are shown in the callouts in Figure 3. Figure 3. Overview of ML work in FG ML5G Y3172 (Callouts added) Autonomous Networks Technical Architecture v1. 0. 0  TM Forum 2021.

# Intent in Autonomous Networks

3. 1 Intent Standardization Efforts Many standard-developing organizations (SDO) are actively working on the topic of autonomous networks and associated intent-driven management. One of the key building blocks of intent-driven management is the intent meta-model which provides an abstract representation of the schema and rules of the intent model, irrespective of the management domain or specific management layer, and enables the extension of such a model wherever necessary, depending on the context of usage. This is critical because the meta-model of the intent is one of the architectural considerations that can influence the functional blocks required for the autonomous network system to derive the semantic meaning and context of the intent as well as helps to map intent to internal actions without ambiguities or conflicts. Table 3 lists some of the key standards in the area of intent-driven networking and categorizes the standards by the following dimensions: conception definition, model, architecture, classification (types, taxonomy), domain (scopes), and lastly, the relevant TM Forum AN Intent Category (Business Intent, Service Intent, Resource Intent).

Page 14 of 17 TM Forums AN Project has also published a suite of guides on Intent in Autonomous Networks. See below for the complete list of guides. 1. IG1253 is a set of documents in which each document defines a separate aspect of intent-driven operation: 2. IG1253 - Intent in Autonomous Networks This is the main overview document. It contains a description of general definitions and operation principles. The documents A-E contain and deeper views into some key topics. 3. IG1253A - Intent Modeling This document defines the modeling of intent objects as ontology graphs. It introduces the concept of model federation based on a central intent meta-model and separate domain-specific extensions and information models. This document then defines the central and domain-independent intent meta-model. 4. IG1253B - Intent Information Models (future release) This document adds to the model federation as defined in IG1253A and propose domain-specific extensions and information models. 5. IG1253C - Intent life cycle management and Interface This document defines the life cycle of intent including the roles and responsibilities within the life-cycle. It then defines the interface and API used to execute the life- cycle management operations. This includes methods for communicating, modifying and removing intent objects, as well as negotiating intent content. 6. IG1253D - Intent handler scope and capability management (future release) This document defines a registration and discovery mechanism about the capabilities and scope of operation of distinct intent handler interfaces. 7. IG1253E - Use cases and examples (future release) This document is a collection of use cases with detailed examples that demonstrate how to apply the principles and use the models and interfaces defined in the IG1253 set of documents. Separate to the Intent specification work above, TM Forum has also published a study called IG1259 Study of Telecom Industry Intent Meta-Modeling Approaches that examines the various approaches to intent modeling and intent expression languages from across SDOs and open source communities IG1259.
