Case 1 Autonomous Networks supporting 5G Wireless Optimization Wireless networks are geographically distributed, and mobile user activity varies significantly in different places and at different times of day. This makes the network very dynamic and complex. That complexity is further increased by the diversity of services and of terminal performance, and by the mobility of users. There are thousands of radio feature parameters e.g., Massive MIMO pattern with broad value ranges affect each other and combination reaches millions. In addition, the configuration of radio feature parameters values depend on various wireless scenario and diversified wireless services, the initial radio network feature parameters may not always meet the requirement and the adjustment effort needs to take consideration of interference control, huge parameters combination and frequent traffic change under diverse scenarios. So, it is beneficial to use AI technology to achieve the optimal radio features parameters combination automatically to deliver the best coverage and capacity for the complex wireless environment. The Multivendor area based wireless network deployment scenarios is the typical 5G network deployment scenario, where the operators network is composed of several subnetworks and each subnetwork contains multiple NGRAN Nodes from same vendor which cover different certain areas. The coordination of wireless network optimization for different areas also is the key challenge to achieve the optimal performance for the whole wireless network. Complexity of wireless network The multivendor OSS and different RAN Domain Managers work together with each other for the wireless network optimization to achieve the optimal coverage and capacity for the whole IG1218A Autonomous Networks  Case studies  TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 14 of 15 wireless network in a coordinated manner. The multivendor OSS is responsible for generating and dynamically adjusting the wireless network requirements and coordination policies for different RAN Domain managers by predicting the trend of service performance e.g., traffic change. RAN Domain manager is responsible for the wireless network optimization for the NG RAN nodes in certain area, which includes automatically identifying network issue and selecting the best radio feature parameters pattern based on online iteration optimization. In addition, the optimal radio feature parameters pattern combination is generated by fast predicting the gain value to achieve the scenarioadaptive and trafficadaptive wireless network optimization. AN capabilities of Wireless Network Optimization can be evolved into five levels  L1 system assist human to improve the efficiency for wireless network optimization action execution and wireless network performance awareness.  L2 system additionally analyses the wireless network performance and identify the network issue based on the network issue rules specified by human.

L5 system achieve the full autonomy for wireless network optimization for full scenarios and services Case 2 AI based 4G5G intelligent assurance management With the acceleration of 5G, 4G5G collaborative networks are becoming more complex. On average, more than 500,000 transmission alarms are generated from the entire network of a province every day, it is inefficient to handle them based on specialists experience. Trouble tickets are dispatched based on alarms, redundant and inaccurate trouble tickets may be dispatched the root cause information of faults is not accurate, and the root causes of numerous faults are not provided. This affects onsite troubleshooting efficiency and prolongs the fault recovery time. Automatically analyzes faults from the massive chaotic transmission alarms, recommends fault handling priority according to the network layer of the faults which affects the service. Automatically inferences failure unit according to failure scene snapshot and AIOps algorithm, then distributes incident tickets by OSS. AI, Big data and Fault domain algorithm can be used to transform traditional alarm monitoring to intelligent fault OM. Automatically analyzes 500,000 alarms per day and provides accurate fault location. The number of tickets decreases by 35 as tickets are dispatched based on incidents instead of alarms.

Case 3 Intelligent energy OM of Data center With the rapid growth of data volume, data centres tend to be large or superlarge. A large number of dumb devices or components are not digitalized, require a large amount of manpower for onsite meter reading and collection. Manual Inspection724hours attendance6 to 12 onsite inspections per day, the proportion of manpower cost continues to rise. As a result, Outdated OM methods result in low efficiency and high OM costs. Reliability is facing increasing challenges and risks, potential system risks cannot be identified in advance, and the SLA cannot be guaranteed.

A small potential risk or fault may cause service interruption or service quality deterioration on the entire network. After virtualized infrastructure and softwarebased network elements NEs are introduced to the 5G core network 5GC, network assurance involves the cooperation of multiple systems, such as virtual network functions VNFs, physical devices, and virtualization software. This further increases the difficulty in predicting and preventing network risks and demarcating and locating faults. How to detect and prevent network risks, quickly demarcate and locate root causes of faults, and resolve problems before customer complaints without increasing OM personnel and OM costs is an urgent issue for telecom operators before largescale 5G commercial use. The Huawei 5GC intelligent OM solution combines rich communication technology CT and information technology IT OM analysis experience with artificial intelligence AI, big data, and automation technologies. AI is used for model training, AI inference, intent insight, and intelligent analysis to mine log data, detect abnormal key performance indicators KPIs, implement machineassisted network change detection, and diagnose Network Functions Virtualization NFV crosslayer faults. In this way, core network faults and potential risks can be detected in advance and quickly demarcated and located. Moreover, performance monitoring, fault detection, and fault prevention can be implemented in routine maintenance and change scenarios of the core network, helping ensure normal running of the network and services.  Log analysis Based on OM analysis experience, the AI and big data technologies are used to explore potential device risks in logs as a supplement to alarm events. In addition, multiple data sources such as logs and alarms are associated for intelligent analysis to detect network cloud faults and potential risks in advance and quickly demarcate and locate the faults.  KPI anomaly prevention and prediction and machineassisted network change detection AI modeling and online detection are used to monitor NE KPIs in real time in various scenarios such as routine maintenance, key event assurance, and network change. In the early phase of a fault, exceptions are identified and reported in a timely manner, shortening the fault detection time. The accuracy of exception identification reaches 85.

Page 21 of 22 Benefits of 5GC Intelligent OM  Intelligent identification of potential risks NFV logs are used to analyze network risks 15 minutes in advance, reducing the fault rate by 5. Compared with the traditional method, KPI anomaly prevention and detection can identify 30 of core network service faults and network exceptions caused by NE configuration changes in advance and help quickly demarcate faults.  Quick fault rectification Typical faults are automatically diagnosed within 15 minutes. The time for locating the root cause of a network fault is reduced by 30, and the Mean Time to Repair MTTR of major interruption faults is shortened by 35. Case 7 Intelligent batch 5G base station out of service detection and isolation With the further expansion of the 4G5G hybrid network scale, manual fault locating is often required when a sudden fault occurs. Because multiple technologies can be involved e.g., IP, fiber, microwave, etc., fault locating is difficult and timeconsuming.
