Case 1: Autonomous Networks supporting 5G Wireless Optimization Wireless networks are geographically distributed, and mobile user activity varies significantly in different places and at different times of day. This makes the network very dynamic and complex. That complexity is further increased by the diversity of services and of terminal performance, and by the mobility of users. There are thousands of radio feature parameters (e. g. , Massive MIMO pattern) with broad value ranges affect each other and combination reaches millions. In addition, the configuration of radio feature parameters values depend on various wireless scenario and diversified wireless services, the initial radio network feature parameters may not always meet the requirement and the adjustment effort needs to take consideration of interference control, huge parameters combination and frequent traffic change under diverse scenarios. So, it is beneficial to use AI technology to achieve the optimal radio features parameters combination automatically to deliver the best coverage and capacity for the complex wireless environment. The Multi-vendor area based wireless network deployment scenarios is the typical 5G network deployment scenario, where the operators network is composed of several subnetworks and each subnetwork contains multiple NG-RAN Nodes from same vendor which cover different certain areas. The coordination of wireless network optimization for different areas also is the key challenge to achieve the optimal performance for the whole wireless network.

# Complexity of wireless network

The multi-vendor OSS and different RAN Domain Managers work together with each other for the wireless network optimization to achieve the optimal coverage and capacity for the whole IG1218A Autonomous Networks  Case studies  TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 14 of 15 wireless network in a coordinated manner. The multi-vendor OSS is responsible for generating and dynamically adjusting the wireless network requirements and coordination policies for different RAN Domain managers by predicting the trend of service performance (e. g. , traffic) change. RAN Domain manager is responsible for the wireless network optimization for the NG- RAN nodes in certain area, which includes automatically identifying network issue and selecting the best radio feature parameters pattern based on online iteration optimization. In addition, the optimal radio feature parameters pattern combination is generated by fast predicting the gain value to achieve the scenario-adaptive and traffic-adaptive wireless network optimization. AN capabilities of Wireless Network Optimization can be evolved into five levels: L1: system assist human to improve the efficiency for wireless network optimization action execution and wireless network performance awareness. L2: system additionally analyses the wireless network performance and identify the network issue based on the network issue rules specified by human. L3: system additionally analyses the optimization solution and determine the adjustment actions to be executed based on wireless network requirements and optimization policies specified by human  L4: system additionally determine and update wireless network optimization policies and requirements dynamically based on service assurance intent. L5: system achieve the full autonomy for wireless network optimization for full scenarios and services Case 2: AI based 4G/5G intelligent assurance management With the acceleration of 5G, 4G/5G collaborative networks are becoming more complex. On average, more than 500, 000 transmission alarms are generated from the entire network of a province every day, it is inefficient to handle them based on specialists experience. Trouble tickets are dispatched based on alarms, redundant and inaccurate trouble tickets may be dispatched; the root cause information of faults is not accurate, and the root causes of numerous faults are not provided. This affects onsite troubleshooting efficiency and prolongs the fault recovery time. Automatically analyzes faults from the massive chaotic transmission alarms, recommends fault handling priority according to the network layer of the faults which affects the service. Automatically inferences failure unit according to failure scene snapshot and AIOps algorithm, then distributes incident tickets by OSS. AI, Big data and Fault domain algorithm can be used to transform traditional alarm monitoring to intelligent fault OM. Automatically analyzes 500, 000 alarms per day and provides accurate fault location. The number of tickets decreases by 35 as tickets are dispatched based on incidents instead of alarms. IG1218A Autonomous Networks  Case studies  TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 15 of 16 4G/5G intelligent assurance management AN capabilities of the 4G/5G intelligent assurance management can be evolved into five levels: L1 Manually monitored tool-assisted network alarms. Manually analyze the root cause and recover network. L2 The monitoring rules are manually designed and automatically monitored. Manual operation  system analyze the root cause and recover network.

Case 3: Intelligent energy OM of Data center With the rapid growth of data volume, data centres tend to be large or super-large. A large number of dumb devices or components are not digitalized, require a large amount of manpower for onsite meter reading and collection. Manual Inspection724hours attendance6 to 12 onsite inspections per day, the proportion of manpower cost continues to rise. As a result, Outdated OM methods result in low efficiency and high OM costs. Reliability is facing increasing challenges and risks, potential system risks cannot be identified in advance, and the SLA cannot be guaranteed. IG1218A Autonomous Networks  Case studies  TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 16 of 17 The automatic inspection technology automatically collects device data and device status information that is not digitized through image recognition and voice recognition. The full digitization of devices is automatically detected in the following modes: Data collected by the traditional monitor system; Device panel status identification. Identify potential device faults: Identifies and analyses abnormal audio features of devices, Real-time noise reduction, feature extraction, and exception identification. Automatic inspection is implemented to greatly improve inspection efficiency, and further improve the reliability and availability of data centre infrastructure and reducing OM costs.

# Automatic Maintenance for Data center Facility

AN capabilities of Intelligent energy OM of Data center can be evolved into five levels: L1 (Tool-assisted operation): Tool-assisted monitor network status, operator can handle the network fault manually. L2 (Partial Autonomous Networks): system automatic executes system faults recovery action, basically eliminating the need for recovery manually. L3 (Conditional Autonomous Networks): system automatic intelligently identify problems that occur during device running and predict the health status of devices and detect problems, basically eliminating the need for manual awareness  L4 (High Autonomous Networks): system automatic root cause analysis, automatic generation of recovery solutions, automatic decision-making, basically eliminating the need for manual analysis and determine  L5 (Full Autonomous Networks): All-scenario automation, completely autonomous operation and automatic recovery of system faults Case 4: Provide intelligent maintenance to reduce complaints for HBB domain The HBB Maintenance faces many problems, such as a large number of user complaints and many site visits for fault rectification. As a result, the OM cost remains high. A CSP with about 2 million users handles about 15, 000 user complaints every month. Most faults are handled manually and about 70 faults need to be handled on site. HBB Intelligence Maintenance can reduce user complaints and site visits effectively. IG1218A Autonomous Networks  Case studies  TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 17 of 18 Home Broadband Intelligent OM Service Scope Network-based complaints rising generally go through 3 phases as above. Based on the service layer, HBB OM is divided into three case studies: Proactive Faults Prediction and Prevention, Massive fault interception, and Network fault intelligent diagnosis. AN capabilities of the HBB intelligent OM can be evolved into five levels: L1: Tool-assisted monitor network status, and troubleshooting, recovery. Events process automation rate is low. L2: The system automatically detects port-level exception events, the system assists in root cause location, and automatically dispatches FMEs to rectify hardware faults onsite. Events process automation rate is medium. L3: The system automatically detects service-level exception events. Automatically locates root causes, and recovery the software/configuration faults. The system automatically forecasts user compliant risks. Events process automation rate is high. L4: The system automatically detects exception events in real time. The system automatically identifies root cause location, forecasts user compliant risks and makes decisions. Events process automation rate is very high. L5: All-scenario automation(Events process automation rate is 100. ), with the same capability requirements as L4. Case 5 Intelligent home network management to meet Bandwidth Experience Commitments Majority of users complaints are caused by the issues of home networking and home network equipment. As the traditional home network is unmanageable, resulting in long failure recovery cycle, high OPEX, and low user satisfaction. Therefore, operators need a more intelligent management system to create better broadband experience, reduce OPEX, analyze new requirements for the home intelligence networking and introduce new services opportunity. The home network intelligent OM solution can meet the requirements: Make the home network more visible, CSP easily monitor the status and indicators of the network continuously, and can determine whether the network is fault; Automatically identify the relationship of the user experience and indicators, find out the root cause of the network fault or poor experience, provide recommended solutions, and help operators to quickly and remotely troubleshooting; Automatically configure the device when root cause is related to some configuration, and IG1218A Autonomous Networks  Case studies  TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 18 of 19 recoveries network failure or improve user experience before subscribers can perceive, so as to reduce complaints and improve subscribe satisfaction. Home network domain close-loop IG1218A Autonomous Networks  Case studies  TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 19 of 20 AN capabilities of the Intelligent home network management can be evolved into five levels: L1: Tool-assisted monitor network Topo and network status, operator can handle the network fault manually. L2: Continuously monitoring the home network, CSP can analyze the root cause manually and automatic recovery execution. L3: Automatic perception of abnormal status of home network, automatic identification of issues, and CSP can analyze the root cause manually. L4: Automatic root cause analysis, automatic generation of recovery solutions, automatic decision-making, and automatic recovery execution  L5: All-scenario automation, with the same capability requirements as L4 Case 6: 5G Core Network Intelligent Operation and Maintenance The core network plays an important role in the carrier network. A small potential risk or fault may cause service interruption or service quality deterioration on the entire network. After virtualized infrastructure and software-based network elements (NEs) are introduced to the 5G core network (5GC), network assurance involves the cooperation of multiple systems, such as virtual network functions (VNFs), physical devices, and virtualization software. This further increases the difficulty in predicting and preventing network risks and demarcating and locating faults. How to detect and prevent network risks, quickly demarcate and locate root causes of faults, and resolve problems before customer complaints without increasing OM personnel and OM costs is an urgent issue for telecom operators before large-scale 5G commercial use. The Huawei 5GC intelligent OM solution combines rich communication technology (CT) and information technology (IT) OM analysis experience with artificial intelligence (AI), big data, and automation technologies. AI is used for model training, AI inference, intent insight, and intelligent analysis to mine log data, detect abnormal key performance indicators (KPIs), implement machine-assisted network change detection, and diagnose Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) cross-layer faults. In this way, core network faults and potential risks can be detected in advance and quickly demarcated and located. Moreover, performance monitoring, fault detection, and fault prevention can be implemented in routine maintenance and change scenarios of the core network, helping ensure normal running of the network and services. Log analysis: Based on OM analysis experience, the AI and big data technologies are used to explore potential device risks in logs as a supplement to alarm events. In addition, multiple data sources such as logs and alarms are associated for intelligent analysis to detect network cloud faults and potential risks in advance and quickly demarcate and locate the faults. KPI anomaly prevention and prediction and machine-assisted network change detection: AI modeling and online detection are used to monitor NE KPIs in real time in various scenarios such as routine maintenance, key event assurance, and network change. In the early phase of a fault, exceptions are identified and reported in a timely manner, shortening the fault detection time. The accuracy of exception identification reaches 85. IG1218A Autonomous Networks  Case studies  TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 20 of 21  NFV cross-layer fault diagnosis: The system comprehensively analyzes fault information, such as NE alarms, configurations, KPIs, and logs, in the space and time dimensions in the cross-layer topology to form a rule workflow for diagnosing faults. This helps automatically analyze and demarcate NFV cross-layer problems and shortens the cross-layer problem handling duration. Figure: 5GC intelligent OM system The Autonomous Network Levels of the 5GC intelligent OM are described as below. L1: assisted management. The system monitors the network running status in real time, reports alarms in a timely manner, and helps demarcate and locate faults, rectify faults, and restore services based on expert experience. L2: partially autonomous network. Static rule/policy based, Execution automation. In some fault scenarios, single-layer faults of a single NE are visualized, and exceptions of KPIs based on static thresholds are visualized and alarms are reported. Users use tools or the system to locate faults, and the system provides recovery suggestions to help users formulate recovery solutions. L3: conditionally autonomous network. Dynamic rule/policy based, Analysis automation. AI is preliminarily involved. The preset model of the system automatically identifies faults and reports fault events based on multidimensional data (alarms, KPIs, logs, and user records) in the space and time dimensions, and automatically demarcates faults based on preset fault scenarios to help formulate recovery solutions. L4: highly autonomous network. Intent driver, Closed-loop control, Decision automation. On the basis of L3, expert experience and AI are efficiently collaborated. The system automatically identifies service impacts and fault severity and reports them. The system presets repair templates or rules to implement fault self-healing in limited scenarios. L5: fully autonomous network. 5GC-related network risks and faults are automatically predicted, prevented, and rectified. IG1218A Autonomous Networks  Case studies  TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 21 of 22 Benefits of 5GC Intelligent OM  Intelligent identification of potential risks: NFV logs are used to analyze network risks 15 minutes in advance, reducing the fault rate by 5. Compared with the traditional method, KPI anomaly prevention and detection can identify 30 of core network service faults and network exceptions caused by NE configuration changes in advance and help quickly demarcate faults. Quick fault rectification: Typical faults are automatically diagnosed within 15 minutes. The time for locating the root cause of a network fault is reduced by 30, and the Mean Time to Repair (MTTR) of major interruption faults is shortened by 35. Case 7: Intelligent batch 5G base station out of service detection and isolation With the further expansion of the 4G/5G hybrid network scale, manual fault locating is often required when a sudden fault occurs. Because multiple technologies can be involved (e. g. , IP, fiber, microwave, etc. ), fault locating is difficult and time-consuming. Therefore, the intelligent root cause locating function needs to be added to help the monitoring front office to analyze and locate the fault root causes. This feature implements refined management of out-of-service faults of wireless base stations, distinguishes different fault causes, effectively detects unexpected faults, and enhances the management of out-of-service faults and incidents of wireless base stations. To address existing challenges, the intelligent preprocessing of 5G base stations out of service in batches solution constructs autonomous capabilities in three scenarios: Intelligently mine alarm correlations with AI to implement intelligent identification of multi- vendor cross-domain faults and incidents. Automatic diagnosis of multi-vendor faults and incidents based on expert experience  In-depth analysis of batch out-of-service faults and incidents through all-domain lossless information collection and association analysis IG1218A Autonomous Networks  Case studies  TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 22 of 23 Business Value: The intelligent preprocessing solution provided to the customer for 5G base station out-of-service in batches improves network autonomy, greatly improves maintenance efficiency, reduces a large number of invalid work orders, and improves the overall network quality.

3. 1 Autonomous Networks hyperloops for enabling Smart-X industries The advent of 5G is pushing CSPs to rethink their business models and to come up with new designs and deployment strategies to cater for vertical specific enterprise case studies. 5G adds the capacity and latenc y to support a wider range of case studies, device types and network architectures (edge, virtualization, network slicing, SD/NFV, SD -WAN, AI/ML), but it also comes with its own set of challenges such as increased network complexities and management issues. To address these challenges, CSPs need to rapidly adopt a new e nd-to-end architecture which is controlled and managed autonomously. Autonomous Networks with zero wait, zero touch and zero trouble capabilities are needed to support the diverse set of vertical use case requirements. Once Autonomous Networks are in place, B2B companies like smart cities and service providers, B2C customers, digital service providers and telecom service providers will benefit from enhanced quality of seamless experience and improved operational efficiency. In addition, the end-to-end life cycle complexity will be hidden behind the scenes and experience assurance will in inbuilt. The new Autonomous Networks framework enables greater agility and provides best practices for much faster launch of new services and solutions.
