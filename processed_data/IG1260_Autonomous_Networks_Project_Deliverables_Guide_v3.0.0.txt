What is the Autonomous Networks Project The journey from automation to autonomy is both a business and a technology challenge that requires some straightforward implementation and integration patterns to achieve selfgoverning autonomous networks. These concepts and patterns need to be agreed upon and adopted by all stakeholders in the larger AN ecosystem. TM Forum has created the Autonomous Networks collaboration project to begin this work. As stated in the AN Vision guide IG1193, Autonomous Networks will 1. Provide fully automated ZeroX zerowait, zerotouch, zerotrouble innovative, critical networkICT services for vertical industries users and consumers. 2. Support SelfX selfserving, selffulfilling, and selfassuring networkICT infrastructures and services for enabling the digital transformation of vertical and telecom industries through the full lifecycle of operations. 3. Offer disruptive services for innovative user experience, missioncritical services based on fully automated lifecycle operations and selforganizing, dynamic optimized resources. 4. Comprise a simplified network architecture, virtualized components, automating agents and intelligent decision engines to create intelligent automated businessnetwork operations for the closedloop of new digital business.

Business Architecture workstream The Business Architecture BA workstream focused on business requirements and AN framework  and as such represents the business need and solution to endusers and CSPs. It is developed per the AN Vision IG1193 and define the overall business requirements, services, framework, AN levels, key business capabilities, E2E full lifecycle of AN operations and provides example use cases to illustrate the usage of AN. It serves as an input to the detailed work in the Technical Architecture TA workstream, as well as the baseline to the regularly published AN white paper and the SDO industry collaboration efforts. 3.2. Technical Architecture workstream The Technical Architecture TA workstream details how the TM Forum AN Framework can help realize these future autonomous networks. The AN TA builds upon the AN Framework while also leveraging other TMF frameworks as ODA, eTOM, SID, and Open API program to propose an evolutionary path toward the mechanisms that are required to deliver a layered architecture operational layers and autonomous domains, one that decouples integration complexity intent and leverages autonomic closed control loops to realize selfoperating capabilities. 3.3. AN MultiSDO Collaboration Autonomy and autonomous systems are complex areas and the industry needs standards to guide on the best way to achieve autonomy and ultimately deliver on Autonomous Networks vision. Ideally, these standards should fit well together and form a coherent whole. Several standards developing organizations SDOs have been IG1260 Autonomous Networks Project Deliverables Guide v3.0.0  TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 8 of 22 working together for an aligned vision of AN with better collaboration between Industry Stakeholders. TM Forum has facilitated this multiSDO initiative with these leading SDOs and this MSDO group have met regularly since early 2021.
