Page 8 of 41 Executive Summary This document provides business requirements and business framework of services and infrastructure supported by Autonomous Networks, including the user requirements per user stories, key business capabilities and framework, and related key metrics for measuring autonomous levels, as well as new business models of production, ecosystem, collaboration. In addition, examples of the lifecycle of Services are illustrated for understanding the usage of business requirements and framework. This document serves as the general guideline for pertinent work streams and work items, including user stories and use cases, technical architecture and interfaceAPIs specs, PoCscatalyst projects, testing and verification, as well as industry collaboration. Moreover, it will be used as the baseline for the marketing plan, campaign, social events and public whitepaper on behalf of the TM Forum and member companies. In order to guide the development of Autonomous Networks, a toptodown, user centric and business driven approach is used to derive the general business requirements and define overall business framework for formulating some common services and capabilities of Autonomous Networks. The common Autonomous Networks Services are categorized into five types as the matrix of business growth  operational efficiency, as well as automation  autonomy  Business growth 1. Network services automation e.g., VPN, SDWAN, 5G connectivity 2. Autonomous ICT services e.g., network  cloud  edge 3. Autonomous digital enabling services e.g., ICT services  platforms operations, collaboration  Operational efficiency 4. Network operations automation e.g., predefined services and operations 5. Autonomous Networks operations e.g., platform based, dynamic process, flexible production operations The key requirements of business framework of Autonomous Networks are as follows  The basic business metrics of Autonomous Networks is called ZeroX experience, which specify the overall characteristics of Autonomous Networks services including zerowait, zerotouch, zerotrouble and zerofriction. The measure of autonomous level of AN service is based on the autonomy automation  intelligence of E2E lifecycle of the services from customer perspective, rather than the technology andor element implementation.  The fundamental ingredients of Autonomous Networks are simplified infrastructure, closed loops, autonomous domain, intent driven interaction. The simplified infrastructure is the fundament of Autonomous Networks, which implies fewer layers, fewer hops in the context of network architecture, less complicated protocols, more automated network management  operations. The closed loop is the core operation of Autonomous Networks, which represents the full lifecycle of related business, including userbusinessserviceresource closed loops. The user closed loops is the main thread to streamline and drive the E2E lifecycle of services. Autonomous Domains are the basic logical business entities to expose network resourcesfunctionalities as servicescapabilities in support E2E lifecycle of automated intelligent networkICT services.

Page 10 of 41 Introduction The ultimate goal of Autonomous Networks is to enable the digital transformation and seamless service experience of vertical industries and consumers through Autonomous NetworksICT services, meanwhile improve the operational efficiency of the telecomICT industry through automated, intelligent close loops of operations. Obviously, it requires the ecosystem  collaboration across the industries, among the service providers, suppliers, and integrators, as well as the customers. The main drivers of the ecosystem and collaboration are the business value and customer experience enabled by the autonomy of Autonomous Networks, which can offer a simplified, easytouse and dynamic networkICT services and capabilities. Therefore, a usercentric, business driven, toptodown approach is essential to the success of Autonomous Networks. The Autonomous Networks should focus on the innovative, common and open methods to minimize the complexity, cost and fragmentation, and maximize the flexibility, efficiency and experience of telecomICT services and infrastructure. It is of necessity to depict the requirements and characteristics of common services of Autonomous Networks, and autonomous levels of AN services the architectural functionalities and capabilities support the above services, which they serve as the common business languages for all partners to communicate and collaborate. The term Autonomous Networks describes the telecom system including management system and network capabilities that can be selfoperating with minimal to no human intervention. Autonomous Networks essentially is an integrated set of programmable systems, bring highvalue and personalizing experience for customers, support CSP to improve efficiency, enable innovation, and increase revenue, with overall network agility, security and resiliency. It is essential to derive a set of general business requirements and offer common business framework and capabilities for various user scenarios, and more importantly a set of key metrics to measure the autonomous levels of those business capabilities following the same criteria of overall autonomous levels defined in vision document.

Roles and Responsibilities of Autonomous Networks In the context of Autonomous Networks, responsibilities regarding operations have to be clearly defined and assigned to roles. Similar as defined by 5, the roles related to AN include  AN Service Customer ANSC Uses AN services  AN Service Provider ANSP Provides AN service at various levels of operations per AN framework, i.e., at business, service and resource levels, to design, build and operate its AN service. The ANSP provided AN service can be built with or without underlying infrastructure.  AN Solution Provider ANSOP Supplies AN solution. It could be at autonomous domain level with or without underlying infrastructure. The underlying infrastructure could be virtualized or physical elements. Depending on actual scenarios  Each role can be played by one or more organizations simultaneously.  An organization can play one or several roles simultaneously. Figure 5.

Autonomous Networks Framework and Capabilities 4.1. Autonomous Networks Framework The framework of Autonomous Networks identifies 3layers  4closed loops 3layers are common capabilities of operations that can be utilized to support all scenarios and business needs  Resource operations layer mainly provide network resources and capabilities automation in each autonomous domain level.  Service operations layer mainly provide the capabilities for network planning, design, rollout, provisioning, assurance and optimization operations across multiple autonomous domains.  Business operations layer mainly provide the capabilities for customer, ecosystem and partner business enabling and operations for Autonomous Networks services 4closed loops to fulfill the full lifecycle of the interlayer interaction 1 User closed loop the interaction across three layers and three closed loops to support the user service fulfillment. 2 Business closed loop the interaction between business and service operations, which may trigger related service and resource closed loops in its fulfillment. 3 Service closed loop the interaction between service and network resource operations 4 Which may trigger related resource closed loops in its fulfillment. 5 Resource closed loop the interaction of network resource operations in the granularity of autonomous domains. IG1218 Autonomous Networks Business Requirements and Framework v2.2.0  TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 23 of 41 Figure 6. Autonomous Networks Framework Autonomous Network Framework as shown above illustrates the rationale of correlation and interaction among the closed loops of different layers  User closed loop is the main thread to streamline the businessserviceresource closed loops.  Each businessserviceresource closed loop is to address the interaction between adjacent layers.  The interaction between adjacent layers is to be simple, business driven and technologyimplementation independent, i.e., communicating and fulfilling the intents businessserviceresource rather than technologyprone commands based the intent mechanisms and interfaces.  The different intents are used for the interactions of different layers, i.e., business intent, service intent and resource intent. 4.2. Autonomous Networks Levels As described in clause 1, through analyzing a collection of user stories, common Services are defined as the template of the service offering, which is further developed with AN business requirement and capabilities. The autonomous levels are used as the common model and metrics to measure and fulfill the AN service, and corresponding business requirements customer experience, SLA and key capabilities across the industry ecosystem and partners e.g., customer, CSP, solution provider and integrator etc.. IG1218 Autonomous Networks Business Requirements and Framework v2.2.0  TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 24 of 41 Figure 7. Autonomous levels for AN services and capabilities In order to measure and fulfill customer experience and SLA, the corresponding autonomous levels will be defined, which are used to guide the improvement of network automation  intelligence, evaluate the value and benefits of AN services capability, and guide the intelligent upgrade of CSP and vendors. The driving force for defining the autonomous levels  Align the AN concept telecom industry conforms a unified understanding of AN, and promotes a consistent understanding of the value of different levels of AN.  Align the roadmap of AN capability telecom industry reaches a consensus on the development of AN capabilities, driving the industry ecosystem to develop according to the roadmap. The categorization of AN Levels is illustrated in Table 7. The basic criterion is that the autonomous levels of AN services are based on the closed loops of business lifecycle and value, for instance, if the closed loop is only fulfilled at the element level, it is at most in Level 1 if the closed loop is fulfilled at the E2E full lifecycle of select AN service, it is in Level 4. Table 7. Levels of Autonomous Networks IG1218 Autonomous Networks Business Requirements and Framework v2.2.0  TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 25 of 41  Level 0  manual management The system delivers assisted monitoring capabilities, which means all dynamic tasks have to be executed manually.  Level 1  assisted management The system executes a certain repetitive subtask based on preconfigured to increase execution efficiency.  Level 2  partial Autonomous Networks The system enables partial automatic OM for certain units based on predefined rulepolicy under certain external environments.  Level 3  conditional Autonomous Networks Building on L2 capabilities, the system with awareness can sense realtime environmental changes, and in certain network domains, optimize and adjust itself to the external environment.  Level 4  high Autonomous Networks Building on L3 capabilities, the system enables, in a more complicated crossdomain environment, analyze and make decision based on predictive or active closedloop management of service and customer experiencedriven networks.  Level 5  full Autonomous Networks This level is the goal for telecom network evolution. The system possesses closedloop automation capabilities across multiple services, multiple domains, and the entire lifecycle, achieving Autonomous Networks. The evaluation process of AN levels requires setting up baselines and identifying weaknesses to formulate phasespecific objectives and improvement strategies. Operation task baselines are defined based on Table 7 from the perspective of the entire OM process planning, construction, maintenance, optimization and operations. For each operation task, generic technological requirements and level evaluation rules are defined from the domain and service perspective, providing a reference for defining and instantiating domainspecific ANL. 4.3. Key requirements of AN capabilities Autonomous Networks should support the following capabilities Table 8. Key capabilities Simplified infrastructure The simplified infrastructure is the fundament of Autonomous Networks, which implies fewer layers, fewer hops in the context of network architecture, less complicated protocols, more automated network management  operations. Closed loop The closed loop is the core operations of Autonomous Networks, which represents the full lifecycle of related business, including userbusinessserviceresource closed loops.

The interactions across the different layers should be based on simple, intent based API interfaces. 2 Business closed loop the interaction between business and service operations. 3 The operations need to be upgraded from isolated business to on demand, automated business collaboration and ecosystem, which enables the closed loop for customerbusiness ecosystem operations, normally requiring collaboration across multiple service providers globally. 4 Service closed loop the interaction between service and network resource operations. The operations need to be upgraded from legacy customized projectcentric approach to a dataknowledge driven platform based on full lifecycle operations automation. The most important part is a mindset change from a buildand operate to a design with operate, and the recognition of the value of operations knowledge as a service KaaS. KaaS is about delivering the right knowledge to the right person in the right context at the right time via desktop, laptop or any mobile device. Operations automation sits at the core of production efficiency and business agility. 5 Resource closed loop the interaction of network resource operations in the granularity of autonomous domains. The network needs to be upgraded from fragmented, siloed network element level integration towards a closed loop of network autonomous domain with extremely simplified network architecture, which lay the foundation for the closed loop of network operations and collaborative production by means of cross autonomous domain collaboration. 4.3.2. Autonomous domains Services involve multiple layers and closed loops. Autonomous domains serve as the basics unit that can fulfill the closedloop automation of the lifecycle of specific network operations of Autonomous Networks based on the business disposition of network functions and operations . This reduces technical complexity and conceals the variations of different vendor implementations, thus supporting E2E business requirements of AN services. The boundary of autonomous domains is based upon the network operation requirements and business decision of each CSP. The instantiation of autonomous domain can be defined by CSP based on the factors such as service types, network technologies, deployment locations, and maintenance organization relationship. The examples of autonomous domain instances can be the closed loops of access, metro backbone, core, edge, customer network from infrastructure perspective, or SDWAN, VoLTE, CDN etc. from service perspective. IG1218 Autonomous Networks Business Requirements and Framework v2.2.0  TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 27 of 41 The basic principles of the operations of autonomous domains are  Autonomy of individual autonomous domain each autonomous domain runs in selfoperating mode per business objective and hides the details of domain implementation, operations and the functions of the domain elements to the users of autonomous domains, with local intelligence and localized knowledge.  Collaboration of cross autonomous domain multiple instances of autonomous domains can be collaborated by upper layers service operations using the intent driven interaction to fulfill the lifecycle of networkICT services.  Closed Loop Automation automation uses closed loop mechanisms to assure service experience by completing workflow steps and continuously adapting to ensure goals and objectives are met. The control loop adjusts and adapts itself, keeping the system in the desired state. Figure 8. Principles of autonomous domains The key characteristics of autonomous domains  Can model the exposure of network and service capabilities as a platform andor services to enable higherlevel business services to utilize network capabilities at the domain level instead of element level.  Can specify a set of rules at the business level e.g., Service level availability, service level guarantee based on response times, repair times etc. that can be automatically monitored and effected across all domains of the architecture in support of closed loops.  Can be instantiated per business dispositions that represent network operations of the future e.g., access, edge, core, network services and so on.  Each instantiation can be decoupled from another and expose a set of domain based services via common intent driven interaction Open APIs to upper layer or other domains.  Can be easily nested and integrated by external management systems. For example, data reporting and query capabilities are provided externally. Programmable management service mechanisms allow users to customize data formats, facilitating interconnection with various external management systems and managing various devices. 4.3.3. Intent driven interaction Autonomous Networks need to be able to adapt their operation to the business objectives of the operator as well as expectations of customers and users. The role of intent is to communicate all these expectations to the Autonomous Networks. Intent IG1218 Autonomous Networks Business Requirements and Framework v2.2.0  TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 28 of 41 establishes machine processable knowledge about goals, targets, requirements and constraints. Intent defines what Autonomous Networks are expected to achieve, but it leaves the details of how a network is designed and operated to the internal operations of the network platform. This means that the smart software on the platform can constantly optimize how the service is delivered, and we can incrementally add new technologies like Analytics and Machine Learning to constantly improve the implementation. Intent is comprehensible It must be understandable by humans, while being formally and unambiguously specified to be processable by machines. It must be comprehensive in what it specifies for matching the semantics within autonomously operated domain, and the scope of autonomously operated tasks. Intent is declarative It leaves room for the Autonomous Networks to explore options for finding the optimal solution. Intent declares the wanted results rather than prescribing a specific solution. Ideally, intent expresses a utility level goal that describes the properties of a satisfactory outcome rather than requiring a specific outcome. Intent is infrastructure agnostic and portable The expectation expressed by intent originates from contracts and business strategy. It does not change if the underlying system is replaced or modified. While implementation and capability differences between system vendors will continue to exist, intent can be ported between system generations and implementations. Intent is complete Intent defines all goals and expected behavior. If it is not specified as intent, it is not a goal the system needs to consider. This also means that concerns that were common sense in human operated systems would need to become explicitly expressed as intent. Intent is composable Multiple intents are given to the Autonomous Networks, and it is expected to consider them altogether. Unlike traditional software systems, where requirements are analyzed offline to detect and resolve conflicts prior to implementation, intents are added during runtime. Therefore, an essential capability of an autonomous system would be to detect and resolve conflicts. Intent is persistent Intent is valid as long as the goals and requirements it expresses are relevant. For example, an intent that specifies a service needs to be delivered would not become invalid once the service is initially provisioned. Intent is rather the reason for keeping the service operational and assure its performance. Therefore, intent has a life cycle that is actively managed by the user or function that has generated it. Intent is measurable It uses measurable and ideally standardized metrics to define the target state. This allows automated evaluation of success as well as identification of issues and optimization opportunities. Intent is layered It is layered with Business, Service and Resource Intent. Business Intent as the top layer. Service in the middle and Resource in the bottom layer. Layered intent mechanism drives interaction across these 3layered intents in supporting closed loops to deliver SelfX experience. For Autonomous Networks, the Intentinteraction model is a must, not optional. The role of Intent is beyond relieving the burden of the user knowing implementation details. More importantly, it sets the autonomous systems internal goal. And the system then takes proactive actions to achieve the stated goal based on its observation of the environment. So intent is the fundamental mechanism to utilize the service of the Autonomous Networks. IG1218 Autonomous Networks Business Requirements and Framework v2.2.0  TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 29 of 41 Intent represents the concerns and objectives of the users of an Autonomous Network. It therefore varies with the diversity of user types and roles  Business intent represents the objectives of a business user. This includes for example the delivery of a custom application defined by SLA. Operators expect their Autonomous Networks to operate service contracts while meeting revenue targets. Their customers expect a good user experience.  Service intent represents the objectives of a service user. A service is expected to deliver functional as well as nonfunctional attributes. This includes targets, for example on connectivity, bandwidth, latency or availability.  Resource intent represents the objectives of resource users. Resources are expected to be allocated so that performance and quality of service targets are met. This indicates that intents target a great variety of concerns across Autonomous Networks Architecture. Therefore, the handling of intent is distributed throughout the Autonomous Networks layers and autonomous domains. The interactions between different layers are through intent APIs. For example, business intent would be handled in business operation and resource intent would be handled within the autonomous domain that matches the concerns addressed by the intent. An intent handling function is the basic architectural building block to assemble intent based operation. Figure 11 shows the intent handling function with its intent API. The diagram also illustrates by example how various instances of intent handlers are allocated across the layers and functional domains. Intent can originate directly from user input through frontend portals. Additional intent would be derived automatically, for example from contracts and service orders. An intent handling function would operate its domain by analyzing the discrepancy between the observed state of the network and the wanted state expressed by intent. The main task of intent handling would be to close this gap as much as possible. It determines the optimal operational state according to all given intent and then acts to transition the network into this state. This process includes the resolution of inevitable conflicts between intent through prioritization and optimization. The intent handling function can act by defining the goals of neighboring or subordinate domains through further intent. Furthermore, for all intent that is given to an intent handler, it is expected to report progress and status back to the source of the intent. This closes a loop. The intent mechanism is therefore instrumental for creating control loops throughout the Autonomous Networks Architecture.

Simplified infrastructure The simplified infrastructure fundamentally guarantees an intelligent and hierarchically Autonomous Networks. The simplified network architecture, protocols, devices, sites, and deployment solutions offset complexity caused by ultrahigh bandwidth and vast connections, improving efficiency and customer experience throughout the network lifecycle. For instance, the network is flattened, and the complexity of network maintenance is reduced by simplifying network layers. Simplified network protocols facilitate network configuration and maintenance. Services are decoupled from the physical network, adapting to different service scenarios on one network and allocating network resources on demand. The unified cloud platform supports cloudbased transformation of multiple service systems, IT systems, and related scenarios and processes. Meanwhile, more realtime sensing components and AI inference capabilities are introduced to network devices for making them smarter. In this way, the digital sensing capability of resources, services and surrounding environments has been enhanced, edge intelligence capabilities such as sensing analysis and decision execution are provided at the data source. For instance, AI models are injected to the networks through cloud collaboration for online inference, the networks are capable of automated fault analysis, locating, and predictive parameter adjustment, devices can be capable of multidimensional realtime awareness and data reporting, as well as working with the management and control platform to implement realtime network visualization and minutelevel fault discovering. 4.3.5. SelfX Operating capabilities In order to support the full lifecycle of user closed loop, the key capabilities are categorized in a tiered manner. Although those capabilities may be applied to the operations within a single layerdomain, they are mainly considered in support of the crosslayer closed loops in the context of Autonomous Networks.

FullStack AI in Autonomous Networks On Autonomous Networks, AI can be used anywhere as needed. Similar to a human brain in terms of perception, training, inference, decisionmaking, and execution processes, AI capabilities need to be provided at different layers of Autonomous Networks. Autonomous Networks are developing towards fullstack AI.  Business operations layer Customer and businessoriented AI focuses on implementing intelligent applications for various business processes, including precision marketing, customer intent translation, customer experience, and flexible combination of products and offerings.  Service operations layer AI oriented to service intents and crossdomain collaboration focuses on implementing intelligent applications for various service processes, including service intent translation, E2E resource orchestration and scheduling, SLA policy production, and E2E fault and performance management.  Resource operations layer AI in an autonomous domain is responsible for local lightweight development, model retraining, and AI asset management, efficiently implementing generalization and iterative optimization of local intelligence, and supporting intelligent perception, analysis, decisionmaking, and execution on local networks. NE AI can comprehensively detect network status in real time and perform inference, improving devicelevel autonomous analysis and processing.

The value of these indicators lies in two aspects 1 Visualizing and quantifying the effectiveness and benefits of AN evolution and 2 Aligning the development of autonomous capabilities with the enterprise strategy and service development trend. Effectiveness indicators are selected based on the ZeroX and SelfX visions. Effectiveness indicators and ANL are two key AN evaluation factors that jointly facilitate the fulfillment of the AN vision.
